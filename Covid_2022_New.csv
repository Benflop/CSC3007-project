Given the higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant, we are likely to experience an infection wave that is greater than that of Delta. Although there may be proportionately fewer severe cases or deaths due to Omicron’s lower severity and continued protection from our vaccination and booster efforts, when multiplied over a much larger number of cases, it could still result in a significant number of individuals requiring intensive care unit (ICU) care, and put significant pressure on our healthcare system. Hence it is important that we put in place appropriate response measures to prepare ourselves well for this upcoming wave. 2.             We had earlier shifted our approach to manage Omicron cases like other COVID-19 cases, including to transit Omicron cases to prevailing Protocols 1-2-3, and allow for home recovery instead of isolating them at dedicated facilities. Moving ahead, we will further streamline the management of COVID-19 cases by enhancing Protocols 1-2-3. In particular, we will work with our primary care doctors to enable them to trigger Protocol 2, to support low-risk individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms in recovering safely in the community. To maximise the level of protection that our population has against the Omicron variant, we will also require individuals to get their booster shots in order to maintain their fully vaccinated status. Updates on Local Situation and Detected Omicron Cases 3.             Our local COVID-19 situation remains within control. Over the past week, daily case numbers have been around 200 on average. 16 cases are currently in ICU care. These figures are significantly lower than when we experienced a peak in infection numbers a few months ago, indicating that the recent wave of Delta infections has subsided. 4.             However, we are seeing a growing number of confirmed Omicron cases even as the Delta wave subsides. Over the past week, we have detected 1,281 confirmed Omicron cases, comprising 1,048 imported cases and 233 local cases. This makes up around 18% of our local cases in the last week. With higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant, we are likely to experience another wave of community infections soon. Revised Healthcare Protocols 5.             Since 11 October 2021, we have simplified our healthcare protocols as part of the broader shift towards personal responsibility and self-management as appropriate. This has enabled the majority of COVID-19 patients to self-isolate or recover at home safely once tested positive. Patients with mild symptoms who are on home recovery programme generally recover quickly in the comfort of their home without the need for further medical care. Prevailing evidence also indicates that Omicron, while more transmissible, is also less severe. We will therefore further enhance the use of Protocols 1-2-3 to facilitate streamlined management of COVID-19 cases. From 6 January 2022, we will manage individuals based on the severity of symptoms and health status, as laid out in the revised protocols below. Our primary care doctors will be key, as we allow patients to recover at home and avoid hospitalisation. 6.             For low-risk individuals with mild symptoms, primary care doctors can make an immediate diagnosis via a healthcare-administered antigen rapid test (ART) and continue to care for them under Protocol 2. To elaborate, after seeing the primary care doctor who has ascertained that their symptoms are mild and that they are at low risk of developing severe symptoms: a.    The individual will be required to self-isolate at home for at least 72 hours. Following which, if they feel well, they may exit self-isolation and resume normal activities upon a negative self-administered ART, similar to Protocol 2. Those who continue to test ART positive should continue to self-isolate and self-test daily until they obtain a negative ART result, or until Day 10 for vaccinated individuals or Day 141 for unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals, whichever is earlier. b.    The individual will receive a 5-day Medical Certificate from the primary care doctor (or longer, depending on clinical discretion) to cover the expected period of rest needed for the symptoms to resolve. If symptoms worsen or do not improve with time, the individual is advised to return to the doctor or call 995 in emergency situations. c.     Health Risk Warnings (HRW) will be issued to the individual’s close contacts, including those identified through the TraceTogether app and self-declaration of household members. Persons issued with HRW should follow the prevailing Protocol 3. 7.             Individuals who are assessed by their doctors as high risk (e.g. elderly, pregnant, immunocompromised status) or with significant symptoms (e.g. chest pain, shortness of breath, prolonged fever) will continue to be managed under Protocol 1 where they are required to undergo both ART and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swabs and, if tested positive, will be issued an Isolation Order (IO) for 10 or 14 days, depending on their vaccination status. 8.             Low-risk individuals who are well and/or asymptomatic will continue to be managed as per existing Protocol 2 if they test positive on ART. 9.             The Ministry of Health (MOH) will monitor the situation in the coming weeks and make further adjustments to gradually allow more individuals to safely recover under Protocol 2 after seeing a primary care doctor, and support their earlier return to normal activities. Booster Dose Required to Maintain Fully Vaccinated Status 10.          Vaccination, especially boosters, retain substantial protection against severe disease for COVID-19 and against the Omicron variant. Nevertheless, the protection from the primary series vaccination wanes with time and is substantially reduced six months after the last dose in the primary vaccination series. International data has also shown that protection against Omicron variant from a primary vaccination series is weaker compared to that against the Delta variant, while boosters increase the protection against infection and severe illness from Omicron. 11.          In view of these, the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) has recommended that persons aged 18 years and above who completed a primary vaccination series should receive a booster dose of an mRNA vaccine2 no later than 270 days after the last dose in the primary vaccination series. This will also apply to individuals who received recognised non-mRNA primary vaccination regimens offered under the National Vaccination Programme, such as three doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac, or three doses of Sinopharm vaccines, as well as regimens of other WHO EUL vaccines. For this group, most will not be due for booster for some time. We expect the Novavax vaccine, which is a non-mRNA vaccine, to be available to them as an option by then.  12.          Taking into account EC19V’s recommendation, from 14 February 2022 onwards, persons aged 18 years and above who have completed the primary vaccination series of COVID-19 vaccines and are eligible for booster vaccination will be considered as fully vaccinated for 270 days after the last dose in their primary vaccination series. They should receive their booster vaccination from around 5 months thereafter as recommended and no later than 270 days thereafter, to ensure an optimal level of protection. Upon receiving their booster, they will continue to be considered as fully vaccinated beyond the 270 days. 13.          For example, if an individual completed his primary vaccination series on 1 June 2021, he would be eligible for a booster vaccination 5 months later, i.e. from 1 November 2021 onwards, and would have to receive his booster by 26 February 2022 to continue to be considered as fully vaccinated.3   14.          For vaccinated persons who have recovered from COVID-19, no additional booster dose is required at this point in time. However, recovered persons who were unvaccinated or partially vaccinated before their infection should receive one dose of the mRNA vaccine (two doses if they are taking Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine4) at least three months after infection to be considered as fully vaccinated. The 270-day vaccination validity period does not apply to recovered persons who complete this vaccination requirement. Learning to Live with the Omicron Variant 15.          We remain committed to living normally with COVID-19, while protecting the vulnerable and ensuring that our healthcare system can cope with any future infection wave. This is why it is important that everyone plays their part in getting their vaccinations and booster doses promptly, complying with safe management measures, testing regularly, and following the necessary health protocols if tested positive. We also seek Singaporeans’ continued cooperation and support in complying with the revised protocols and measures, as we roll them out in the coming weeks.    MINISTRY OF HEALTH5 JANUARY 2022[1] Day 1 is taken as the date of positive healthcare-administered ART.[2] Persons who are medically ineligible to receive the mRNA vaccine may consider taking the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, which is the only non-mRNA vaccine offered under the National Vaccination Programme, as a booster vaccine. The Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine should otherwise not be used as a booster vaccine for other groups. [3] Eligible individuals can walk in at any Moderna vaccination centre during operating hours, while appointments can be made for Pfizer-BioNTech/Cominarty vaccinations.[4] For recovered individuals who have received a mixed vaccine combination incorporating Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccines, please refer to details of the requirements at https://go.gov.sg/sinovac-mixed-vac-combi.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/strengthening-our-readiness-to-live-with-the-omicron-variant,

Then Senior Minister of State Dr Janil Puthucheary and then Minister Chan Chun Sing will address another two set of questions on child vaccination. May I request that we deliver our replies, and then all three of us take supplementary questions please? 2.     Singapore just weathered a significant COVID-19 transmission wave, caused by the Delta variant, which is still active in many parts of the world. 3.     By working together, making collective sacrifices to restrain our social interactions, watching out for each other, and implementing sound policies, we have overcome perhaps the most difficult part of the pandemic. 4.     As of now, our hospital situation is stable, with 11 COVID-related ICU cases. Most activities have resumed, and we are meeting up with friends and loved ones. Our society has become much more resilient to COVID-19 than before and this is an important milestone. A New Omicron Wave 5.     But a new Omicron wave is upon us. If we work together, we can ride through the wave. Once we have done so, we will be even more resilient than now, even more prepared to live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease. 6.     When Omicron first burst onto the global scene, we immediately introduced measures such as restricting travel from affected countries in Africa, enhancing testing for all travelers, isolating cases in hospital, and reinstating stringent contact tracing and quarantine for Omicron cases. 7.     These measures will not stop Omicron from taking root and spreading in Singapore, given its high transmissibility. However, they have helped to delay its emergence, giving us precious time to understand this variant better, to prepare ourselves. Characteristics of Omicron 8.     The characteristics of Omicron have now become clearer. This is what we know today. 9.     First, local and overseas evidence show that it is far more transmissible than Delta variant, so we must expect a wave that could be several times larger than the Delta wave. So if Delta infections reached a sustained incidence of about 3,000 cases a day, Omicron could perhaps reach 10,000 to 15,000 cases a day, or even more. Cases are likely to double every two to three days. So once cases start to rise steeply, within a couple of weeks, we may see 3,000 Omicron cases a day. 10.     Second, there has been consistent international evidence showing that Omicron infections are less severe than Delta. The incidence of hospitalisation and severe illness is lower, and there are also indications that any hospital stays are generally shorter. Indeed, the clinical outcomes, particularly the number of people who become severely ill or die, are much more important than the topline number of infection cases. 11.     Mr Speaker Sir, may I show a couple of slides on screen just to illustrate this clearly? This set of two graphs describes the situation in South Africa. The blue line, top and bottom is the same line, shows the number of infections, so you can see three humps, reflecting the three waves that they have gone through, the first is Beta, then Delta in the middle, and the latest, the tallest is Omicron, and it is plotted against the scale on the left axis. The grey part for the top graph shows hospitalisations, plotted against the scale on the right axis. And so you can see in the latest wave, the number of hospitalisations is proportionally lower than the previous two waves. The bottom graph is even more stark. The red area shows the number deaths plotted against the scale on the right axis. During the Omicron wave, the red area is actually very small, the number of deaths is proportionally much lower than the past two waves. Next slide is similar for the UK. Proportionally much fewer hospitalisations and fewer deaths.12.     A study by health authorities in South Africa showed that 4.9% of cases were admitted to hospitals during the Omicron wave, compared to 13.7% during the Delta wave. Among the patients admitted to hospital during the Omicron wave, they were 73% less likely to have severe diseases. 13.     In the UK, the risk of being admitted to hospital or emergency care with Omicron was about half of that of Delta. 14.     Data from Denmark also showed that about 0.8% of Omicron cases were hospitalised, lower than the 1.2% rate of hospitalisation among cases infected with other variants. 15.     This has also been borne out by our own local experience. In Singapore, as of last night, we have recorded 4,322 Omicron infections so far, including 308 seniors aged 60 and above. Eight of them, out of the 4,322, needed oxygen supplementation, and all of them have been taken off oxygen after a short few days. None required ICU care as yet. 16.     In comparison, if these 4,322 infections had instead been caused by Delta, we would expect 50 to 60 patients needing oxygen supplementation, ICU care or to die. 17.     However, we should be careful in interpreting these observations. It is early days and the circumstances of each country are different. South Africa for example, has a very young population and a high level of natural immunity, even though their vaccination coverage is low. 18.     The UK has both high levels of vaccination and natural immunity, and this current Omicron outbreak is riding on the back of a protracted Delta outbreak, which worsens clinical outcomes. 19.     Further, Omicron transmits much faster and infects more people. So even if a small percentage of infected individuals falls very sick, because of the large base of infections, it can lead to many people needing ICU care, or die. 20.     Third, vaccines, especially boosters, retain substantial protection against severe disease. Indeed, the most recent studies in the UK found that for vaccinated individuals, the risk of hospitalisation for Omicron is reduced by 72% compared to the unvaccinated. With a booster shot, vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation is estimated to be 88%. 21.     Currently, Omicron has spread to over 130 countries, and has become the dominant strain in many places. Hence, we lifted the suspension of flights from affected African countries and aligned the healthcare protocols between Omicron and other COVID-19 variants. Our Responses 22.     Members would like to know our strategy in responding to the Omicron wave. 23.     Given that it is less severe than the Delta variant, and vaccines still work against it, our key objective remains, which is to live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease. Then, we can lead life as normally as possible, and continue to build a bright future for Singapore and our children. 24.     That includes not locking down our borders, which will inflict tremendous pain on families, workers, businesses, and also the mental well-being of our people. In any case, a severe lock down strategy will likely delay but not prevent the inevitability of Omicron finding its way into our community. 25.     There are two factors working in our favour. · First, a high percentage of our population is vaccinated and more are getting their boosters each day. · Second, unlike many European countries which have to contend with a double whammy of a concurrent Delta and Omicron wave, we have only recently gone through our Delta wave. So we are not likely to have to ride through two rapidly rising infection waves. 26.     In recent days, our overall local infection number is creeping up, to a few hundred a day, with Omicron accounting for about 40% of all cases. Given the transmissibility of Omicron, we expect the numbers to rise steeply in the coming weeks and Omicron will become the dominant variant within a few weeks. 27.     The responses that we have developed against Delta will continue to be relevant against Omicron, with some adjustments. And there are three responses essentially. 28.     First, vaccination and boosters remain key. In countries where Omicron has spread, the unvaccinated and under-vaccinated are still most prone to falling seriously ill when infected. 29.     Mr Dennis Tan asked for a breakdown of COVID-19 deaths. There were 802 such deaths in 2021, of whom 555 were not fully vaccinated. Although the unvaccinated is a small proportion of our population, they contributed to 70% of the deaths in 2021. 30.     The remaining 247 were vaccinated with a range of locally available vaccines. I am going to read out some crude incidence rates, but be mindful, we are calculating this based on quite a small sample of 247 deaths of individuals who are vaccinated. And they are as follows: 79 deaths per 100,000 for non-fully vaccinated persons overall; 11 deaths per 100,000 for those vaccinated with Sinovac, 7.8 per 100,000 for Sinopharm, 6.2 per 100,000 for Pfizer-BioNTech, and 1 per 100,000 for Moderna. 31.     These rates are only indicative as I mentioned, sample size is small and as they also do not account for other factors which may affect mortality such as the age and the timing of vaccination. 32.     Around 132,000 individuals aged 18 years and above remain unvaccinated today, while around 300 persons are medically ineligible. We will continue to try to convince those who are medically eligible to get vaccinated, through their primary care physicians, public messaging and the media. But as Members will appreciate, as the number gets smaller, it becomes harder and harder to convince them. 33.     For those who are homebound, our Mobile Vaccination Teams can visit their homes to vaccinate them. 34.     Over the past months, we have managed to vaccinate well over 90% of every eligible age group. It is quite an achievement. We are especially happy to see that amongst seniors aged 60 to 69, and 70 and above, 96% and 95% have been fully vaccinated respectively. 35.     As for those aged 12 to 19 years, 95% are fully vaccinated. For the even younger ones aged 5 to 11, we have just started vaccinating them. The response has been good and operations have been smooth. 36.     At this time, only the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine is authorised for use in ages below 18 years. We will continue to closely monitor the availability of other vaccines, including non-mRNA vaccines that are approved for use in children. 37.     At the same time, our vaccine booster programme is gathering pace. About 46% of our population has received their boosters. We have recently brought some 900,000 individuals aged 18 to 29 into the booster programme, of whom 700,000 are already eligible to receive their boosters today. Our booster coverage will continue to expand over the month of January. 38.     We have also set a validity period for full vaccination status of 270 days, as a strong signal to our population, please get your boosters promptly. 39.     As to whether there is a need for further booster shots, fourth shot, fifth shot, it is too early to tell. Today, Israel is the only country that has authorised a fourth dose for non-immunocompromised individuals. 40.     For an endemic infectious disease like Influenza, we can draw some inference from there. This virus mutates frequently, so people receive vaccinations every year to protect themselves against it, without many problems, or the need for disruptive border closures and social restrictions each time there is an infection wave. It is a possible future scenario when we live with COVID-19 as an endemic disease. 41.     MOH and EC19V will continue to monitor local and international data on the durability of protection from vaccine boosters and the evolution of the virus, to assess the need for further vaccinations. 42.     Second, we will continue to enhance our healthcare capacity. We have made preparations to ramp up capacity and manpower of the Home Recovery Programme, Community Treatment Facilities (CTFs) and the public hospitals. We stand ready to provide up to 350 ICU beds, 2,000 isolation beds and 4,000 CTF beds for COVID-19 cases with a couple of weeks’ notice. 43.     Particularly, for hospital ICU capacity, existing single rooms and isolation rooms can be repurposed into additional ICU beds when required. Medical equipment and consumables are ready. Manpower is always a limiting factor, but ICU staff has increased by 12% over the past year to about 1,800 now, and we have trained or are training about 500 more staff to assist with ICU operations. 44.     Anti-viral medications for COVID-19 have been used to treat vulnerable patients who are at high risk of falling severely ill. When authorised for use and made available in Singapore, these oral anti-viral medications will be important additions to the range of COVID-19 therapeutic agents already in use locally. We have signed or are negotiating supply agreements for these medications, but unfortunately, I am not at liberty to release details due to confidentiality obligations in these contracts. 45.     Outside of the hospitals, we will be enhancing our healthcare protocols to right site patients, so that hospital resources go to those who need them the most. The MTF has recently announced our partnership with primary care doctors to care for patients who are recovering at home after being tested positive with Antigen Rapid Tests, under what we termed Protocol 2. This will help them safely recover and return to normal activities as soon as possible. 46.     I should caution Members against thinking that coping with a transmission wave successfully is a matter of recruiting more healthcare workers and building more ICU facilities. Our objective is not to have more people falling very sick and admitted to ICU, but in fact to avoid it. 47.     Hence, we size our emergency healthcare capacity based on what is sustainable and practical, bearing in mind this is a crisis of a generation, the capacity needed cannot be provided within our usual redundancy provision, and ICU-trained staff do not just increase multi-fold overnight or even over a few months. Hence, we have to try to temper the infection numbers through Safe Management Measures and exercising self-restraint in our social interactions. 48.     So vaccinations, expansion of healthcare capacity, and Safe Management Measures must work in tandem, and we must strike a balance between the three factors. 49.     We cannot, for example, over-liberalise social activities, remove all social restrictions, let infections rise uncontrollably and leave the healthcare system to bear the consequences. Neither do we swing to the other extreme, protect the healthcare system at all cost, go for a zero-COVID strategy, and lock down our borders and society which will cause tremendous suffering to our people. 50.     How the three factors balance off each other, is a matter of judgment depending on the pandemic situation. It will be too rigid to set metrics and parameters to trigger social restrictions, as we need to respond flexibly and appropriately to the twists and turns that the pandemic situation may take. 51.     This brings us to the third response, which is Safe Management Measures. In recent months, instead of imposing across-the-board social restrictions, we introduced Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS). 52.     This is because unvaccinated individuals are at far higher risk of falling severely ill. This group have consistently taken up two-thirds of our ICU beds, throughout the pandemic. By restricting their social interactions, we protect them against infections and serious illnesses and taking up hospital resources. The rest of society who have been vaccinated can also then live life more normally. 53.     However, there are presently no plans to introduce VDS for children aged 12 and below in community, public, preschool and school settings. This is due to a combination of reasons, namely, children are less likely to develop severe illnesses when infected, and we want to preserve as much as possible universal access to holistic education for children. 54.     For now, children aged 12 and below who are Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or Long-Term Pass Holders, and did not travel recently will continue to have their COVID-19 medical bills fully covered by the Government. This is regardless of their vaccination status. 55.     So in general, while we have a strict VDS system in place, to enable society to carry on normal lives as much as possible while protecting the unvaccinated, the rules are much less strict for children, based on the reasons I explained earlier. 56.     Members asked if we are likely to tighten up social activities because of the Omicron wave. When the Delta wave subsided late last year, we refrained from being too jubilant and over relaxing restrictions. That would have been a mistake. We kept our mask requirements, did not allow back night entertainment, and kept group sizes at five. 57.     It is the MTF’s hope that we can ride through the Omicron wave with the current Safe Management Measures posture. If we have to tighten the restrictions, it will be as a last resort when our healthcare system is under severe pressure. Conclusion 58.     I believe that just as we have ridden through the Delta wave with unity and resolve, we will be able to do so again with the Omicron wave. Omicron is a different enemy, but we are much better prepared and much more resilient than before. And after the Omicron wave passes, which it will, we would have taken another huge step towards living with COVID-19. Singapore will be one of the best and safest places to live in on Earth.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/response-to-omicron-wave,

For example, caregivers can access respite care at senior care centres for a few hours in the day, or at nursing homes for seniors with higher care needs and who need round-the-clock care. As at end December 2021, we have over 450 respite care places.Providers do not maintain places to wait for demand, but will activate places to meet service requests. The availability of respite care places is therefore fluid, and providers are generally able to meet the demand. The take-up rate for respite care has decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic as caregivers may prefer to minimise the community exposure of their loved ones.

They are where rural populations migrate to, in search of a better life. They are the nerve centres of industries and economies, ideas and culture. They are magnets for humanity, and cauldrons for new ideas and social movements. They are where hopes and dreams are expressed and fulfilled.4     But there is a dark side to cities too. Cities can also breed crime, vice, social inequality, disease, and cause environmental degradation. 5     Cities are filled with paradoxes. Along with triumphs, there are defeats. Where there is hope and optimism, there is also despair. They have been the central stage where the story of humanity has unfurled, reflecting how societies think, behave and point their moral compasses.Cities Past and Present 6     Today, I will start by recounting the stories of a few great cities – past and present. I will then draw out key lessons from these cities, and talk about their implications for Singapore, both our present and our future.Jericho 7    My first example is Jericho, in the Fertile Crescent of the Middle East. It was one of the oldest human settlements dating back to 9,000BC. An old city born of geographical advantage – a combination of good climate, fertile soil, and an abundance of fresh water.8     These conditions enabled hunter-gatherers to settle over time and cultivate crops. These were a close-knit people from a very early civilisation. As their numbers grew, a city was formed.9     With accumulated wealth from agriculture, the people of Jericho established the city as a trade station, leveraging their strategic location along the Jordan River, to trade with peoples as far away as Egypt and Anatolia.10     With wealth came the need for defence and protection. Inhabitants built up fortifications, most famously the walls of Jericho. Defence has always been a public good. For a city to defend itself, it needs to raise taxes, mobilise and organise resources. And therefore we see the emergence of a state administration.Chang An11     This leads to my second set of examples - political capitals, such as Rome, Chang An, Constantinople, Kaifeng and Pataliputra.12     These too began as well-located settlements, but gained strategic significance, as their rulers consolidated territories around them. Eventually, they became the full-fledged political and economic capitals of empires.13     These capitals had a few common features. One, they were often situated at a confluence of trade routes. For example, Kaifeng was located amidst a network of canals and handled huge volumes of shipping cargo. Trade was often state sponsored and driven, and to provide the resources to sustain an empire.14     Two, these capitals had defensive advantages. For example, Constantinople guarded the only inlet to the Black Sea, and was surrounded by water on three sides.  This left it open only to land invasions from the west.15     Three, they were the seats of great powers, and developed significant military and technocratic prowess as capitals of empires. For example, Rome had a governing Senate, and an established code of law, which still forms the foundations of many modern legal and democratic systems today.New York City16     The third set of examples are present day metropolises – New York City, London, Paris, Tokyo, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Singapore.17     With industrial revolution and technological advancement, came the free flow of capital, and the world became increasingly globalised.18     The globalised world is characterised by complex networks of trade, financial services, maritime, aviation, infocomms and other activities, and these networks in turn need to be served by nodes or exchanges. Global metropolises managed to establish themselves as those nodes in a global economy.19     With technology, the influence span of a modern metropolis is no longer limited by the stamina of a horse, nor by the proximity to waterways or canals. Their significance is determined by the breadth of their networks, strategic clustering of industries, rich flow of capital and ideas, and most importantly, their ability to attract and retain talents from all over the world.20    Hence London no longer depends on the Thames because it is not tethered to its maritime roots. Its transformation into a global financial centre and a hub of creativity, culture and the arts has allowed it to keep its position in the world.21     On the other side of the world, Silicon Valley and its smaller cities like Palo Alto and Cupertino – the start-up and technology capital of the world - have overtaken the coastal city of San Francisco.22     The idea of cities has therefore evolved, from gatherings of close-knit people who settled where climatic and geographical conditions were most benign, to political and economic centres from which nations and empires were ruled and defended, and finally, to financial and commercial hubs in a globalised and interconnected world.Cities Rise and Fall23     However they come to be, cities rise and fall with the tide of history.24     The same geographical luck which gave rise to ancient cities such as Jericho can also be their undoing. Natural disasters, climate change and foreign invasion - can all turn a city’s fate. Today, Jericho is a pale shadow of its former self, as part of a disputed territory in the West Bank.25     As for political capitals such as Rome or Chang An, their character and significance shifted along with the rise and fall of their parent empires. Rome was plagued by constant threats of invasion, and its military and administration were overextended to defend its massive territory. There was an erosion of civic trust in the ruling elite. Chang An was decimated at the fall of the Tang dynasty as the empire fragmented.26     These cities did not ‘decline’ exactly. They remain major population centres but their character has totally changed. Rome is still the capital of Italy, but the commercial centre has since moved to Milan. Rome literally has layers of history buried below its surface, which makes it hard for the city to redevelop and reinvent itself.27     As for the great modern metropolises, they are constantly jostling for relevance in a hyper-competitive global economy. If a global node can be established, it can also be unplugged by a competitor.28     Maintaining the vibrance and relevance of a city over generations is therefore no mean feat.Singapore – A City, State and Nation29     I cite these examples because I think there are lessons in each one that can enrich our collective endeavour to keep Singapore a thriving city at the cutting-edge, as well as a stable and sustainable home for all of us.30     Singapore cannot be modelled against any of the examples I raised, and not even the modern metropolises.31     This is because history has made us unique. We are a city, a state and also a nation of one people, all rolled into one. In Singapore, we find some of the essence of New York City, Chang An and Jericho. Our future success depends on us recognising the importance and combining the essence of all these great cities – past and present.The City of Singapore32     Let me start by talking about the New York City in us.33     We are a global economic node. This is central to our survival as a city. Without economic opportunities and the prospect of a better future for its people, a city loses its dynamism and life.34     Especially for a city like Singapore, without a natural hinterland, maintaining our economic viability has always meant being connected to the world.35     One of our pioneer leaders, Mr S Rajaratnam, set out our ambition of becoming a “Global City” in a speech to the Singapore Press Club in 1972, a whole two decades before our next speaker, Professor Sassen, would popularise the term.36     Mr Rajaratnam saw Singapore as a growingly important component of the global economic system, side by side with the economic giants of the world.37     In large part, we achieved this ambition through decades of hard work and enterprise. We leveraged our geographical location to build a trading hub, and from there, other strategic industries - manufacturing, tourism, biomedical, finance and infocomms, aviation, research and development.38     To use a more contemporary analogy, we have become like a smart phone with a good operating system and all kinds of apps. Your contacts, schedule, group chats, music, photos are personalised and stored in here.39     This is the value proposition we want to keep offering to the world. Strong enough, so that it is not easy, though not impossible, to switch out of Singapore.40     The great task before us is to keep reinventing ourselves to stay relevant. We have made good progress as a smart nation. We are fast becoming a centre for green finance.41     We have long term plans to reinvent our cityscape, such as developing the land to be vacated by Paya Lebar Air Base, and reimagining our city centre with the inclusion of the Greater Southern Waterfront, which is the size of three Marina Bays. The city centre will look entirely different, decades from now.42     But I believe the biggest opportunity for reinvention lies in the post COVID-19 world. In many ways, the crisis is like a reset button, forcing us to rethink the way we do things in smarter and better ways.43     For example, the post COVID working world should embrace a combination of working in the office or at home, as a more efficient arrangement to be outcome focused, and to help people juggle their lives.44     We should rethink the concept of ‘peak’ commuting hours, which has so long dictated the planning and development of transport infrastructure. We can flatten the traffic curve too.45     COVID-19 has pushed many hard-hit brick-and-mortar establishments onto digital platforms.46     Having gone through Home Based Learning, education is undergoing another renaissance, kicked off with every secondary school kid equipped with a personal device, embracing the digital medium for education, and encouraging self-directed learning.47     In healthcare, we now have a much better appreciation of the importance of primary care, which includes things like good hygiene, vaccinations, and home recovery with the support of tele-medicine. This may be a new beginning for primary preventive care, which will be the most important component in an ageing population.48     Through the pandemic, we have positioned ourselves as a hub for vaccine manufacture and distribution.49     The process of coping with the pandemic has tested our mettle as a city. We had to roll with the punches and adapt to many twists and turns. We didn’t try to shut down every infection cluster, but we braved through, and rode the infection wave. To do this, we have had to rely on people’s personal responsibility and civic consciousness. We have to trust that people will do the right thing, in testing themselves, and isolating themselves if they are tested positive.50     While these have been done out of necessity, I believe it has helped us grow as a people. I hope it is the start for a societal attitude that is more forgiving of imperfections, embracing setbacks and failures, appreciating resilience, ruggedness, enterprise and even being unconventional.The City State of Singapore51     There is also a Chang An in us, even though we are no empire.52     This is because we need to run an effective state. In Singapore, our people do not have a choice between a free-wheeling urban economic centre or a quiet life in the suburbs.53     There is also no equivalent of Washington DC, Canberra, or Brasilia outside of our global city. This city is all we got. Within these 730 square kilometres, lie all the possible choices for five million people.54     The Government of Singapore must defend our city and maintain law and order.  It must ensure that all our infrastructure and services - from healthcare, education and transport to utilities and refuse collection, libraries and parks, are all well provided for and working well.55     What Singapore has been blessed with is a founding generation that has built up a good Government, with a capital ‘G’.56     This includes the various arms of the state - an executive branch that is effective and can get things done; a non-politicised civil service; and a judicial system that upholds the rule of law without fear or favour. It also includes democratic institutions such as parliament, formed through free and fair elections.57     But the affairs of the state cannot run away from politics. Therein lies a duality.  On the one hand, politics facilitates public discourse, puts the fate of the country ultimately in the hands of people, keeps powers in check and maintains accountability of the executive branch.58     On the other hand, politics gone wrong can polarise the population and destabilise societies. We have seen many recent examples.59     So a critical factor for good governance, is to get politics right. Rather than endless bickering and stalemates, the political process must be constructive, and help bridge divides. The objective of politics must be to help the country find a way forward even if the decisions involve very difficult trade-offs.60     This is especially important to Singapore. For what we lack in resources and strategic mass, we can make up with nimbleness, and unity of purpose and action.  We may be small, but we can move fast and we do things together.61     What are the starkest political differences that need to be reconciled today?62     Post Industrial Revolution, and throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the biggest conflict has been between the Right and Left. Creation versus distribution of wealth. Socialism versus Capitalism. That was the defining divide that characterised the political struggles of almost every country. An ideological struggle that defined modern history.63     However, post globalisation and the Internet, modern societies face new contradictions. Economic and income growth are important and desired by many, but can also stratify society and hinder social mobility. The challenges and stresses of international competition can make people turn against globalisation and foreigners. Resource exploitation depletes the life of our planet.64     In other words - inequality, protectionism and climate change. These are some of the biggest issues that nations and their Governments across the world have to grapple with today.65     To reconcile the dilemmas of modern societies and deal with these issues, we need a strong state. Otherwise, it will not be possible to do difficult but necessary things such as a carbon tax to reduce emission, or redistributive policies to help the low income, or reform education, health or other significant public policies and programmes.66     Our policies need to be consistent for the long term to make an impact. Unlike bigger countries, we cannot afford to be caught in fractious politics with frequent change of Governments and reorientation of policies that come with it.67     This does not preclude the value of healthy discourse that takes in diverse views, and the proper functioning of checks and balances – both of which can strengthen our health and functioning as a state. The success of the Singapore state depends on our ability to achieve both aims.Singaporeans68     But the most crucial aspect of Singapore is the Jericho in us.69     The sense that despite being in a global city, we are members of a close-knit tribe, sharing a common fate and destiny. A recognition that by working together and making sacrifices for one another, we have a better shot at a brighter future.70     Except unlike the inhabitants of Jericho, we are not a natural tribe of similar origins. Singapore is a far more diverse and complex society than any ancient city.71     Having a seat at the table at the United Nations, or a flag to compete under in the Olympics, does not a nation make. The litmus test of what it means to be a nation is in our Pledge - ‘One United People’.72    This makes nation building a long term, subconscious process. A nations’ people will need to have common experiences, and go through trials and tribulations together. Over time, this togetherness will forge common ideals that transcend primordial tribal instincts, and overcome forces that deepen social fault lines.73     Then something mysterious emerges, beyond security, beyond making a living, beyond creature comforts – like, the soul of a nation.74     For ancient civilisations like India and China, the sense of nationhood is almost second nature, having been born of millennia in time. In Europe, religious beliefs played a big part in forging the sense of togetherness over centuries. The United States of America is a relatively young country, held together by the ideals of individual freedom and liberty.75     In Singapore, we are working on what it means to be Singaporean, day by day.  Students singing Majulah Singapura daily at school assemblies; different communities living side by side in HDB estates, visiting the same hawker centres and public parks; cohorts of youngsters performing National Service together, total strangers instinctively connecting with a Singlish phrase, even thousands of miles away from home, like our shared secret code; and, battling crises like the COVID-19 pandemic together. These are all acts of nation building.76     Many of these come through deliberate policies and programmes implemented by the state.77     Take our bicentennial commemoration in 2019 for instance. We wanted to figure out what best describes the Singapore DNA. After consulting widely, we shortlisted three descriptors – openness, multiculturalism and self-determination.78     At the end of the exhibition at Fort Canning, members of the public were asked to vote for the descriptor that resonated with them most. By a wide margin, we chose self-determination.79     It is not surprising. Cities don’t need it; many states don’t even think about it; but a young nation like us dreams of and cherishes self-determination.80     It was a pity COVID-19 disrupted the process and we could not take the exhibition further. But we should think of other ways to do so, because there is a growing consciousness about why we exist as Singapore and what makes us Singaporean.81     To put that consciousness into words, it is perhaps:82     That we are not just a key node of the globalised world, but the one that connects East and West, and different parts of Asia, creating vast opportunities that surpass the limits of our borders, for our people and future generations.83     That the consistent strengths of the institutions of state will always strive to ensure justice and fairness to all, uphold meritocracy, bring out the best of people, bridge our divides and put us on the right path for the long term.84     That therefore in this nation, there is a solemn commitment to give every community that calls Singapore home a place under the sun, where everyone also exercises a spirit of give and take rather than pushing for their own agenda at the expense of others, and in so doing, provides space for something that we collectively own as Singaporeans, to evolve over time.85     With all of these, we will determine our own future, and be a city, state, and nation that continues to thrive for many years to come.

SGP,Asia,Singapore,14/1/2022,290030,945,973.714,840,1,0.714,53181.385,173.28,178.545,Welcome Address by Minister for Health Mr Ong Ye Kung At Information Session On Strengthening Health Emergency Preparedness In Cities and Urban Settings On 13 January 2022,"1          It has been two years since the emergence of COVID-19 and the world continues to experience the impact of the pandemic on all aspects of our lives. Collectively, I believe we are in a better position than 2020.2          We know more about the virus. We have safe and effective vaccines against it. We have diagnostics and therapeutics to help manage the pandemic. We have gained valuable experience in implementing non-pharmaceutical public health interventions to slow down the spread.3          However, the world remains in a fragile state as equitable access to medical countermeasures continues to be a challenge in many parts of the world. It is sobering to start 2022 with the observation that both Delta and Omicron are driving up global case numbers at record high levels, stressing even the most well-resourced healthcare systems.4          And one day, we will have to confront Disease X. Is the world prepared enough?  And in Singapore, we constantly ask ourselves – is our city prepared enough?5          As a city-state and an international travel and trade hub, we are especially at risk from infectious threats. During SARS in 2003, we experienced first-hand the economic, health and social devastation that an infectious threat was capable of. We have thus invested heavily in pandemic preparedness and response over the years and that has put us in a better position to respond to COVID-19.6          However even when COVID-19 arrived, we find that there are areas that we are inadequate, in terms of our preparedness. From SARS, we developed a set of protocols that is heavily based on contact tracing, quarantine and containment. But once you have a much more infectious disease such as COVID-19, containment is over time not effective. We had to switch our rulebook to one closer to managing influenza. The world is now 55% urbanised. In 2050, it is estimated 68% will be urbanised. And between now and then, new diseases will hit our countries and our cities. And all cities around the world, where the majority of the population now resides in, will have to come under a system that is prepared enough to protect them, to respond to the disease.7          I think ultimately, we want to preserve human lives. You can’t run away from three major factors, which are: How fast a disease spreads – the R as we call it. How well we prevent people from falling severely sick, which is a function of vaccinations. And then if they do fall very sick, how well does the healthcare system respond to it. And then there is actually a fourth dimension, which is how well the non-medical systems respond to a pandemic like this. Can children go to school? Can people go to work? Can social amenities continue to open so that people have a sense of normalcy? Does the psychology of the society remain strong, resilient and intact? And these are all key aspects of urban preparedness. Singapore has learned a lot through two big episodes of SARS and COVID-19. We will continue to learn from other cities and other member states of WHO.8          In our capacity as a WHO Executive Board member, Singapore has been working with WHO on championing preparedness, especially in cities and urban settings, which is all we have. While the work started even before COVID-19, the pandemic has magnified the essential role that cities and urban settings play in preventing, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from health emergencies. Three broad perspectives worth highlighting:·    First, strengthening preparedness in urban settings contributes to the efforts of State Parties in realising their commitments to the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005).·         Second, independent experts and distinguished luminaries have strongly advocated for the transformation of global pandemic preparedness and response systems. This is an important area to follow up on.·      Finally, we must build on the political momentum to strengthen global, regional, national and subnational preparedness.9          In closing, I would like to express Singapore’s appreciation of the leadership shown by the WHO during this difficult period. I would also like to acknowledge Western Pacific Regional Director Dr Takeshi Kasai’s leadership in guiding important work done in our region.

It is my pleasure to join you at today’s official launch of the SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute of Medical Simulation (SIMS), i3 Hub. Convergence of Technology and Healthcare Simulation 2.    As a former educator, I have had the opportunity to witness first-hand the benefits of healthcare simulation in training healthcare professionals. Till today, it remains a topic close to my heart. 3.    Back in the early 2000s, the use of simulation in the healthcare setting began to take root through the use of task trainers and low-fidelity manikins, which incorporated basic technology. Over the past few years, we have seen an increased adoption of technology in healthcare, which has undoubtedly resulted in greater efficiency, better patient management and more integrated care delivery. Today, in the sphere of healthcare education, technology plays a key role by providing realistic simulated environments that allow learners to hone their clinical skills in a safe, supervised environment. 4.    As technology rapidly evolves, it is also important to keep in mind that the profile of learners has also changed. The new generation of healthcare professionals are digital “natives” who have grown up well-versed in various technologies and their capabilities. They are, therefore, highly adaptable and comfortable with the use of high-tech training modalities. This shift in learner profile calls for continuous review in the methods of engagement and modes of teaching in a digital language they can understand. Enhancing Learning with Serious Games5.    Serious games are by no means a new concept, but one that has been gaining fresh relevance with new learner demographics. The incorporation of serious games in teaching and learning enhances the breadth of healthcare simulation capabilities – offering more engaging and interactive learning opportunities, and empowering healthcare professionals with increased ownership in their learning process. 6.    SIMS has been making great strides in incorporating serious games in its training programmes. Over the last two years, SingHealth has obtained several grants, such as the iNnovative Learning Grant from SkillsFuture Singapore, which supports healthcare educators in the development of serious games to improve learning outcomes. To date, SIMS has successfully completed the development of 18 serious games that cover a wide variety of skills and knowledge across various healthcare professions. 7.    One must truly commend the educators whose relentless and painstaking efforts have driven the development process. Beyond the technology and equipment, each customised game reflects the educators’ passion and drive to share their personal insights, clinical know-how and expertise with learners.8.    One of the benefits of serious games is their ability to simulate difficult or challenging scenarios for learners to practise critical skills in a safe environment. This can be seen in the Acute Care game, developed by the Singapore General Hospital’s Department of Internal Medicine. The Acute Care game uses Virtual Reality (VR) technology to re-create the pressures of these scenarios, in which doctors can practise critical thinking and decision-making skills. For younger doctors, the opportunity for practice without actual risk to patients is reassuring and invaluable in preparing them to face future real-life scenarios. The scenario on management of septic shock is a superb example, as medical professionals need to be well-versed in providing timely diagnosis and accurate treatment for this group of patients.9.    Serious games are also able to facilitate remote and virtual learning, which has become especially pertinent amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Developed by the SingHealth Alice Lee Institute of Advanced Nursing, the Basic Cardiac Life Support (BCLS) game teaches learners how to identify and perform CPR on persons who require it, allowing healthcare professionals to refresh their CPR knowledge and skills remotely without having to congregate in a classroom. Come 2022, it will be integrated as part of the official BCLS certification training across SingHealth, which is attended by up to 5,000 healthcare professionals every year. With the inclusion of the game, in-person hands-on training duration is projected to be reduced by some 25 percent, allowing healthcare professionals to be trained with reduced manpower and cost. Since gameplay is done individually, this not only minimises the risk of COVID-19 transmission as compared to a typical classroom setting, but also offers healthcare professionals greater flexibility to train at their own time, without having to compromise or re-schedule their clinical commitments. 10.    To support the proliferation of serious games in healthcare education, SIMS collaborated with Serious Games Asia to develop the Healthcare-Training and Assessment Hosting Platform (Health-TAP) which was launched in June last year. This cloud-based software is a one-stop integrated platform that hosts serious games for up to 5,000 players at any one time. The platform also collates data across the games in a central repository, which in the future will offer healthcare educators useful insights into learning gaps, and spark ideas for the development of new serious games. Launch of the SIMS i3 Hub11.    The launch of the SIMS i3 hub today is another step forward. i3 stands for “Inspire, Innovate, Incubate”. This launch signals truly exciting times for healthcare simulation, with serious games opening up new opportunities in healthcare learning. As a dedicated space where learners and educators can engage through new technologies and educational modalities, the i3 Hub will serve as a springboard to enable continual innovation that will transform the future of healthcare education in a safe and holistic manner. Closing12.     In closing, I would like to express my heartiest congratulations to Prof Fatimah Lateef and the SIMS team on the successful launch of the SIMS i3 Hub. May the i3 Hub be a catalyst for transformation in healthcare delivery, as we inspire, innovate and incubate new ideas to nurture future generations of healthcare professionals.

It is my pleasure to join you today at the fifth International Meeting for Asia Pacific Maternal and Child Health Conference and Integrated Platform for Research in Advancing Metabolic Health Outcomes of Women and Children (IPRAMHO). As a surgeon and medical researcher myself, I am heartened to join my fellow healthcare colleagues at today’s conference to discuss important topics on supporting women’s and children’s health. 2. Despite the safe management measures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this year’s event continues to draw a strong pool of experts, both locally and across the Asia Pacific region to share their insights. I would like to congratulate the organising team for the good effort.3. For today’s keynote, I would like to focus on two key points. First, the importance of being physically active to keep healthy; and second, to go further upstream to encourage young children to be active to enhance their development and health.Keeping healthy through physical activity  4. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that globally, up to five million deaths per year could be averted if people were more physically active. That is quite a large number, estimated at about 7% to 8% of global deaths annually, which could be potentially avoidable if we encourage individuals to stay active and avert or delay the onset of chronic diseases.5. In addition, globally, one in four adults do not meet the WHO guidelines of having a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-to- vigorous-intensity of physical activity per week.1 It is even more worrying that four in five adolescents, whom we expect to be more physically active, are not meeting the WHO guidelines.6. Locally, the National Population Health Survey Report (NPHS) 2020, showed a rising prevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, higher body mass index and overall lower physical activity amongst Singaporeans aged 18 to 74 years. These risk factors, if left unchecked, can result in cardiovascular diseases such as stroke and heart attack, and lead to poor health outcomes. The survey findings underscore the need for us to do more to remind and encourage Singaporeans to keep a healthy and active lifestyle, even amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.Moving upstream on active lifestyle for early childhood7. This leads to my second point on the need to go further upstream to encourage young children to be active. Studies have shown that a child’s health in early childhood has a lasting impact on his health and well-being later in life.2 For example, obesity in childhood not only puts the child at risk of obesity-related childhood conditions, it also has the long term effect of predisposing them to adult obesity and chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol levels in adulthood.8. It is thus essential for parents and communities to prioritise keeping our children active and healthy. Adopting healthy lifestyle habits should start from young, and it is the best prevention against the development of lifestyle diseases and ill health in our children, which will in turn support them in realising their maximum potential to achieve good health, and social and educational outcomes. KKH-led survey: Lifestyle habits of young children in Singapore9. However, a recent survey that KKH conducted on 340 parents of children from infancy to seven years of age, revealed that more needs to be done to improve the lifestyle habits of our young. The study found that two in five infants, toddlers and preschoolers do not engage in sufficient physical activity. In addition, two in five infants have an average of one hour, and four in five toddlers have an average of 30 minutes of screen time daily. For these two age groups, screen time is not recommended, and should be kept to the minimum. Locally, findings from the GUSTO study have shown that early screen and TV viewing could impact the cognitive development of the child.10. The same KKH study also revealed low awareness among parents on the impact of physical activity and screen time on the health of their children. In addition, half of the parents who claimed to be aware of existing guidelines, were unable to articulate the guidelines correctly. These findings reveal the need to do more to raise awareness and equip parents with the skills and knowledge to keep our children healthy. In doing so, we could empower more families, caregivers and community healthcare providers, to forge healthy habits in our young in their formative years that could last them a lifetime.2022: The Singapore Integrated 24-Hour Activity Guidelines for Early Childhood11. With this need in mind, IPRAMHO, led by KKH together with SingHealth Polyclinics and National Healthcare Group Polyclinics, facilitated a guideline development workgroup, to put together a set of guidelines in four main areas: physical activity, screen time, sleep, diet and eating habits, for infants, toddlers and preschoolers up to seven years old.12. This set of guidelines, called ‘The Singapore Integrated 24-Hour Activity Guidelines for Early Childhood’, aims to help families adopt a structured and comprehensive approach to organising a child’s 24-hour day. It incorporated latest research findings on the effectiveness of adopting physical activities, sleep, reduction of screen time and eating habits of young children, going beyond the National Guidelines on Physical and Sedentary Behaviour for Children below seven years old which was launched in 2013 by Health Promotion Board (HPB). The intent is to cultivate good habits from young which could optimise the child’s health outcome in the long run, and nurture a population that takes charge of its health, contributing to our overall objective of building a healthier next generation.13. In addition, this set of guidelines for early childhood is part of a series facilitated by IPRAMHO and the SingHealth Duke-NUS Maternal and Child Health Research Institute (MCHRI) together with College of Paediatrics and Child Health Singapore and other societies or colleges, to improve metabolic health in women and children, and transform national health. It builds on earlier guidelines that had been introduced for children and adolescents from seven to 18 years old, and those on the management of gestational diabetes, exercise and physical activity for pregnant women, as well as for perinatal nutrition.14. I am heartened to see the strong collaborative efforts of various institutions, professionals and experts coming together to jointly develop the set of guidelines to provide guidance to parents and caregivers. I would also like to thank KKH and MCHRI for taking the lead to make this possible.15. The set of guidelines for infants, toddlers and preschoolers that we are launching today will be distributed to all paediatricians and family physicians in Singapore. This will help them to better support parents and caregivers to improve the health outcomes of our young children. We are looking at other channels to share the guidelines with parents to support them in keeping their infants and young children healthy.16. These efforts are part of series of recommendations of the Inter-agency Taskforce on Child and Maternal Health & Well-being, which was formed last year to look at ways we could better support families and parents in fostering good health and wellbeing for their children, starting as early as the preconception phase. Over the next few months, the Ministry of Health will be sharing more on the initiatives and programmes that would be put in place under the Child and Maternal Health and Well-being Strategy.Closing17. In closing, I would like to thank KKH and all participating institutions for your continued efforts to drive healthy living in Singapore and the region.18. I wish you all a successful conference, and that you will benefit from the exchanging of views and new insights.Thank you.[1] Source: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/physical-activity[2] World Health Organization.

MOH started its investigations following an anonymous feedback in December 2021. Wan Medical Clinic was found to have allowed individuals to allegedly submit to the clinic pre-recorded videos and/ or photos purporting to show that they had performed ART PET on themselves. The clinic then uploaded the negative ART results for these individuals.3. Among other safeguards and requirements, supervised PET must be conducted in real time and in the presence of a registered medical practitioner or qualified self-administered test supervisor. The conduct of any unsupervised PET is a breach of Regulation 12(1A) of the Infectious Diseases (Antigen Rapid Test Providers) Regulations 2021 (“ART Regulations”). Under Regulation 12(4) of the ART Regulations, if convicted of an offence under Regulation 12(1A), the test provider could face a fine not exceeding $5,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 months or both.4. In the course of MOH’s investigations, we also found that a registered medical practitioner in this clinic, Dr Jipson Quah, has been allegedly involved in providing a vaccination service where false information was caused to be submitted to the National Immunisation Registry to indicate that COVID-19 vaccines had been administered to individuals, when they had in fact not received such vaccinations. In this manner, the individuals will be considered as vaccinated and be eligible for all vaccination-differentiated safe management measures.5. Dr Quah was also found to have allegedly submitted a false positive ART result to the Patient Risk Profile Portal, a national healthcare system used by doctors to upload ART results and other patient information, so that the unvaccinated patient could obtain a recovered status and be exempted from vaccination-differentiated safe management measures.6. A police report has been lodged on 21 January 2022 for further investigations to be conducted into the matter.7. To safeguard public health and ensure that clinic practices are in line with national COVID-19 policies and regulations, whilst pending the outcome of investigations, MOH will be issuing notices of intention of suspension to the four medical clinics i.e. Wan Medical Clinic, Mayfair Medical Clinic, Mayfair Medical Clinic (Yishun Chong Pang), and Ong Clinic & Surgery (Yishun), which were licensed to Dr Quah and/or which he is a clinic manager, as well as revoking the ART approvals for these clinics. MOH will also be referring Dr Quah to the Singapore Medical Council for further investigations.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/investigation-into-allegations-of-improper-conduct-of-pre-event-testing-and-falsification-of-vaccination-records,

It has been two years of very difficult work and we have another challenge ahead of us because of the Omicron wave. It is a different wave but notwithstanding that, we know that as the wave peaks, and in the coming weeks it will – it will assert pressure again on our healthcare system. 2.   There are three areas that we particularly watch – one is the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the weekend, ICU bed occupancy numbers dropped from 13 to, as of last night, nine. We have a couple of Omicron patients needing ICU care but they are non-intubated. So we keep our fingers crossed that the ICU situation will remain stable. 3.   The other area that we look closely at is hospitalisation itself. As of now, about 1.3 percent of Omicron cases resulted in hospitalisation, about 0.3 percent require oxygen supplementation and thankfully, usually short – two, three days. The maximum so far has been five days for one case. The numbers have been creeping up in both absolute numbers as well as percentage. It used to be 0.2 percent and over the weekend, 0.3 percent. It has slightly exceeded 0.3 percent. Every 0.1 percent occupies a lot more beds, as we all know. 4.   The third area is what I and many of you are most worried about. It is the impact on our manpower and we have seen it in many other countries. It is not so much that the beds are filling up so fast, but the fact that our manpower is isolated, because of infection or as close contacts. We have adjusted our healthcare protocols, including for hospitals, in line with the science and behaviour of this virus. So isolation is down from 10 days to seven days, and between Protocols 1 and 2, the tracks are now porous. You can smoothly transit from one to another. So you may be on seven-day isolation but along the way if you are fine, after 72 hours with an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) negative test, you can come back to work.  5.   All these will help. But we need to take precautions, and protect our workforce – which is why the Ministry of Health (MOH) had to make the difficult decision to suspend hospital visits again, for another four weeks. It is difficult for the patients and their families. But we are facing a peak of a wave and we have to ride through this, including some of these painful measures. As a result too, today while we are opening our community hospital, there shall be no visit to the hospital, and we will celebrate the opening right here.6.   It is my pleasure to join you here in the official opening of the SingHealth Tower and Outram Community Hospital (OCH) today.Continuous Investment in Healthcare Infrastructure7.   The Singapore General Hospital (SGH) Campus Masterplan was announced by the Prime Minister about five years ago, in 2016. Since then, the campus has been undergoing major development - to improve its facilities and enhance capacity for our growing healthcare needs. 8.   There are several key developments under this Masterplan. First, the new National Cancer Centre, which is progressing well and slated to open later part of this year. Second, the Emergency Medicine Building, which will open progressively from 2024. This will be followed by the new SGH Elective Care Centre and National Dental Centre scheduled to open by 2027.  9.   These developments, and OCH that we are opening today, form Phase One of the SGH Campus Master Plan development. The total development budget for Phase One is around $4 billion. In Phase Two, we will develop the new SGH Complex, together with an improved internal road network. 10.   All these are part of the Government’s continuous investment in public infrastructure, for the benefit of Singaporeans. The entire Campus development is going to take another 15 years or so to complete. Beyond the investment of resources, the entire project requires very meticulous planning and execution.  11.   For example, services and roads need to be carefully shifted so as not to disrupt operations in one of the busiest and oldest hospitals in Singapore. Further, SGH is now 200 years old and this year 201 years old, we are taking great efforts to preserve its heritage features and structures, such as the clock tower in Bowyer Block. The College of Medicine and Tan Teck Guan buildings, where my office is, will certainly also be preserved.Additions to the SGH Campus 12.   As part of the Masterplan development, we are adding two significant features to the Campus today. 13.   First, the SingHealth Tower, which plays a central and strategic role for the SGH Campus. It houses key facilities like the Campus Logistics Hub, Central Kitchen and Sterile Supplies Unit, and administrative staff offices, all of which are also key to supporting the day-to-day operations of SGH and other institutions on the Campus.  14.   These are the silent workers, always in the background. They are essential to any organisation, any Campus. However, in this age of social media and round the clock running of the publicity machinery, we can easily forget their vital contribution, until something goes wrong. I am glad the SingHealth has now provided them with a more pleasant and conducive work environment.   15.   Second, the OCH. Community hospitals have always played an important role in our public healthcare system in helping patients to recover, rehabilitate and reintegrate into the community. OCH is the ninth community hospital in Singapore and one of three under SingHealth. The others are Bright Vision Hospital and Sengkang Community Hospital.16.   OCH, which has a total of 545 beds, is located in the 19-storey SingHealth Tower. It is situated next to SGH, which helps ensure integrated and seamless care across the acute and community hospital on this Campus. 17.   At OCH, programmes and activities are carefully designed to keep elderly patients mentally and physically engaged during their stay in the community hospital. Some initiatives that have been piloted at other community hospitals before being rolled out here, such as the Integrated Primary Care for At-Risk Elderly programme, which connects discharged patients with GPs in their neighbourhood to continue post-discharge care. 18.   Another meaningful programme, which will be rolled out in OCH is the Social Prescribing Programme. The programme will equip patients at the OCH with essential life skills, such as knowing how to use a smart phone, and applications such as WhatsApp and QR code scanning. These skills will help the patients connect with their friends and loved ones, and lead a meaningful and active life after discharge. Better than before they got admitted to the hospital.19.   For patients at their end of life, there is a range of activities to cater to the needs and preferences of patients and their families. For those who cannot be cared for at home, OCH provides Inpatient Hospice Palliative Care Services. The palliative care team offers assistance to alleviate symptoms, and also attends to the patient’s psychosocial needs, enabling them to live out their final days in dignity and with comfort. 20.   For those who wish to remain at home, there is also a day hospice service for palliative patients located in OCH. It is run by HCA Hospice Care, and is the first day hospice to be co-located in a community hospital. 21.   We are deeply thankful that OCH opened in November 2019, just before our nation was struck by COVID-19. As a result, SingHealth could use OCH wards to augment bed capacity whenever there was a surge in COVID-19 cases.22.   OCH has also supported the operations of Bright Vision Hospital, since it was converted to a COVID-19 Treatment Facility. The great majority of COVID-19 patients recover well from home, but there is also a small group of recovered COVID-19 patients who are elderly and frail with existing medical conditions, and need rehabilitation and care at community hospitals. OCH has been receiving these patients and providing the necessary care and rehabilitation. Thank you very much for being part of this battle.Conclusion23.   Congratulations on the official opening of SingHealth Tower and the OCH. I am confident that we will continue to push the boundaries of care and improve healthcare outcomes. With this, I am happy to declare the SingHealth Tower and Outram Community Hospital officially open. I wish everybody Happy Chinese New Year, a Happy Year of the Tiger, and may we rise above all our challenges. Thank you. ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-official-opening-ceremony-of-singhealth-tower-and-outram-community-hospital-(och)-at-och-multi-purpose-function-room-24-january-2022-9.30am,

They can go out if they test negative thereafter.Likewise, under Protocol 3, close contacts of Covid-19 cases can go out only if they self-test negative, for seven days.Recent adjustments to our border measures adopt a similar approach.Travellers arriving on vaccinated travel lane (VTL) flights, many of whom are locals returning home, are already subjected to mandatory pre-departure and on-arrival tests.After their arrival, they must ensure their self-administered tests are negative, if they wish to leave their accommodation or place of residence at any time during the subsequent seven days.

She passed away on 10 January 2022.  Her death was reported to the Coroner, who ordered an autopsy to be conducted. The autopsy found that the main cause of death was pneumonia, with other contributing factors being cerebral infarction (or stroke) and coronary artery disease, which are natural disease processes common in seniors. The Coroner has not determined whether these causes of death were linked to the vaccination. 3     MOH takes a serious view of this incident and is carrying out a thorough investigation under Regulations 14A(1) and 36(1) of the Private Hospitals and Medical Clinics Regulations. We expect the investigations to conclude in February 2022.  Our preliminary findings were that the vaccine was erroneously administered due to possible irregularities in vaccination procedures and poor communication between the nursing home and the medical service provider handling the vaccination. This is the first case of mistaken identity leading to erroneous vaccination by a mobile vaccination team in over 152,000 vaccinations to date. 4     MOH had planned to announce this incident in December 2021. However, the family of the resident had requested to withhold details which could have led to the identification of the resident. We have since consulted the family further and are releasing the information to provide clarity on the incident. 5     We understand that ECON Healthcare Group and PanCare Medical Clinic have co-funded the resident’s hospital bill as a goodwill gesture. ECON Healthcare has also been in contact with the resident’s family to render support to them. 6     Both ECON Healthcare and PanCare Medical Clinic have reviewed their processes to prevent a recurrence. The Agency for Integrated Care, whose role is to facilitate vaccinations in nursing homes, has reminded all nursing homes to ensure proper communications with the mobile vaccination teams when vaccination takes place. MOH has also reminded all mobile vaccination teams to perform independent identity verification and authentication before administering any vaccination.MINISTRY OF HEALTH 4 FEBRUARY 2022",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/erroneous-administration-of-fourth-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-to-103-year-old,

These visits are not necessary, and risk compromising the standard of care for other patients who genuinely require medical attention. 2.     Under today’s health protocols, persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 infection with an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) are to self-isolate at home for at least 72 hours, and if they are well, they may exit isolation to resume normal activities once they test negative on their self-administered ART. They do not need a letter or memo from doctors to certify they have recovered from COVID-19 in order to return to work or to school, including pre-school and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs).3.     Employers and employees are advised to familiarise themselves with the COVID-19 health protocols. Employers should not ask for recovery memos upon return. Employees who test positive for COVID-19 (either through self-test or at a GP clinic) should immediately inform their employers and not return to the workplace, in order to prevent the virus from spreading. Those who are well should be allowed to work from home if they are able to do so. If they are unable to work from home, their employers should treat the period of absence as paid sick leave without requiring a medical certificate (MC) from the employees.4.     For employees who are on Protocol 2, they may self-administer ART after at least 72 hours of isolation. If they are feeling well and test negative, employers should allow them to return to the workplace without requiring any further recovery memo or medical assessment from a doctor. Sharing of the self-test ART results or on-site ART administration can serve as alternatives.5.     Similarly, students and staff who contracted COVID-19, or are issued with a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or Health Risk Warning (HRW) will not have to obtain a recovery memo from their doctors, before returning to school. This applies to students and staff in preschools, Early Intervention centres, the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, Special Education (SPED) schools, junior colleges (JCs)/Millennia Institute (MI), as well as IHLs.6.     To ensure a safer learning environment for everyone, it is important that we all exercise personal responsibility to monitor our own health and the health of our children and family members closely. A student can return to school once he or she feels well, and test negative for COVID-19 after at least 72 hours of self-isolation.

Most of these patients did not require emergency care, and such unnecessary visits to the EDs risk compromising the standard of care for other patients who genuinely require emergency medical care. 2.  The Children’s Emergency (CE) departments at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital and National University Hospital have experienced very high attendances over the past two weeks. This week, there were on average more than 650 cases per day across both CEs, up from an average of 450 cases per day in early January. Approximately 80% of the patients, including those with COVID-19 infections, presented with mild symptoms, did not require hospitalisation, and were discharged after their ED visits. Amongst paediatric patients who were admitted, most did not stay long in hospital, and were discharged on average within two to three days. The proportion of severe COVID-19 infections and Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) remains low, at less than 1 out of 1,000 paediatric cases. 3.  We advise the public to seek medical treatment at a hospital’s ED only for serious or life-threatening emergencies, such as chest pain, breathlessness and uncontrollable bleeding. This allows those with severe illness in need of emergency care to be attended to quickly. It also helps to preserve our hospital capacity for those who truly need acute hospital care. 4.  We urge members of the public, including children, to visit their General Practitioners (GP) or a 24-hour clinic for non-emergencies. If COVID-19 testing or review for symptoms of acute respiratory infection is needed, they can visit Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) for further assessment. Over 700 PHPCs are open after office hours on selected days. There are six paediatric swab centres which support paediatric swabs for children aged 6 years and below, of which 4 are open after office hours on selected days (please refer to the Annex).5.  The public may access the latest list of GP clinics and their operating hours at:The Ministry of Health’s (MOH) corporate website;The Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC) website;Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) webpage; andHealthHub mobile application, which is available on both the App Store and the Google Play Store.     MINISTRY OF HEALTH6 FEBRUARY 2022",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/emergency-departments-are-only-for-emergency-conditions_6Feb_2022,

You were steadfast and strong as our last line of defence. You did your utmost in providing quality medical care despite many challenges. I would like to convey my deepest personal appreciation to all our healthcare professionals.4.         We are now in the midst of an Omicron wave. As expected, it is registering daily cases a few times that of Delta, and the numbers may go up even further. Fortunately, as we have envisaged, it is also a less clinically severe variant as compared to the Delta variant.5.         At the peak of the Delta wave, when we had about 3,200 daily cases, about 170 ICU beds were occupied by COVID-19 patients. Now, with more than three times the number of daily cases, we have about 20 COVID-19 patients in ICU. While our healthcare workers are stretched, it is a different level of intensity as during the Delta wave.6.         We will be monitoring the trajectory of the transmission wave closely. As a fellow Health Minister told me, every country will experience and even shape the curve of their transmission wave. Everyone will have a unique experience. It can rise very sharply and come crashing down in a short few weeks, like South Africa and Australia. It can also remain moderately high and stay  slightly longer as in the case of Netherlands and Denmark. We are trying to co-exist with a force of nature, with measures that we have put in place such as restrained social behaviours and vaccinations. No one knows exactly the impact of these measures and what the final trend line will look like, and what is on the other side of Omicron. It is however comforting and encouraging is that among patients infected, the number of cases with severe clinical outcomes remains low despite the sharp surge in cases. This means it is possible to live with Omicron.7.         A large number of daily infection cases is still a significant threat, and there are still severe cases requiring care. Therefore, we cannot underestimate the impact of a big Omicron wave. There are three aspects that we are paying attention to. 8.         First, while hospitals may not be stressed in the same way as during the Delta wave, we need to ensure that there are sufficient paediatric beds. This is because the Omicron variant is more likely to infect children than the Delta variant. Of all age groups, children aged 5 to 11 currently have the highest infection rate, at about 67 per 100,000 population.  This is followed by young people aged 12 to 19, at an infection rate of about 55 per 100,000 population. This was quite different, compared to during the Delta wave, which mostly infected older and working adults.   9.         With more children and young people getting infected, severe cases are inevitable and we need to ensure that there are sufficient beds for them. Our public and private hospitals are standing up more beds for children. Our COVID-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs) are also converting more beds for children and their caregivers. I just visited Connect@Changi at EXPO yesterday, and there were 660 of such beds being prepared, and hopefully will be commissioned in the next couple of days.10.         Fortunately, children admission to hospitals and CTFs due to COVID-19 is often precautionary in nature, with short stays of about two to three days. Notwithstanding, it important to get them vaccinated to protect them against the risk of severe illness should they get infected.11.         This brings me to the second aspect we are paying attention to, which is vaccination and boosters. They continue to make a significant difference to clinical outcomes of the infected individuals.  Today, 0.3% of Omicron patients need oxygen supplementation or ICU care. Amongst those aged 60 and above and infected with the Omicron variant, 1.8% needed oxygen supplementation or ICU care. 12.         But 1.8% is the average number seniors aged 60 and above. There is a big variance depending on their vaccination status. For those boosted, it is about 1%; for those fully vaccinated - around 4%; and for those not fully vaccinated - around 10%.  Hence, a senior above 60 and not fully vaccinated is more than 10 times likely to fall severely sick when infected with Omicron, compared to someone who is boosted. That is why vaccination and boosters, especially amongst seniors, continue to be our key priority.  Today, over 60% of our total population and 68% of eligible population have been boosted. 13.         Third, because of larger number of daily cases, we had to increase our front-end public-facing operational capacities, namely our call centres, and also our GPs. We are expanding our call operator team with manpower from outside of Ministry of Health, namely the wider civil service, and also the SAF.  We have also noticed that a fair number of patients who have mild or no symptoms are still seeing GPs. Many of them are just to get some form of documentation to be excused from work or school. Several ministries have recently clarified through a statement that this is not necessary during this pandemic, and employers and schools should accept a positive self-test ART result to excuse an individual, and a negative result to allow them to return. I hope they adhere and cooperate with us.14.         Ultimately, the most critical success factor in our response to COVID-19 is the trust in our society. Patients' trust in us is critical and that is built up over a long time when we consistently give our best to serve them. Our colleagues' trust in us is critical when we go through a pandemic, because everyone goes through it together, and perseveres together. That grows only if you continue, through the years, to work as a cohesive team. The pandemic has reminded us of the importance of this ethos to serve and work together as a team. We function as one body, even as separate parts, undertaking different roles.15.         The winners today exemplify this ethos. I would like to share three stories of how some of our healthcare heroes have gone the extra mile and had undertaken innovative initiatives, which benefitted three social groups.16.         I will start with Tanuja Nair, Head of CHAMPS (Child Life, Art and Music Therapy Programmes) from KK Women's and Children's Hospital. During the pandemic, Tanuja and her team witnessed how COVID-19 had an impact on young children due to social isolation. So they developed engagement kits, interactive videos and podcasts, to teach children techniques to cope with isolation. Seven out of 10 children shared that the resources helped them tremendously in coping with loneliness during their hospital stay.17.         Next, we have Ng Beng Wee from Ren Ci Hospital. Together with his team, they created a psychosocial programme - named the ""5Cs of Coping This Season"", to support their colleagues, especially foreign healthcare workers who are separated from their families. The programme comprises self-directed activities and also mindfulness exercises. More than 370 healthcare professionals from Ren Ci Hospital benefitted from it, and about 250 tapped on a voluntary staff support network for peer support and encouragement.18.         Finally, St. Andrew's Community Hospital partnered Changi General Hospital and St. Andrew's Nursing Homes to introduce the Violet Programme. The programme allows critically ill patients to receive appropriate care at home.  The specialists' palliative team would come in during critical episodes.19.         Mdm Sumiah is one such patient who has benefitted from the programme. She received treatment in the comfort of her home. Her medical condition was closely monitored by a dedicated home palliative care team. This saved time and costs for her caregivers as they do not have to take additional time off work for medical visits. Since its introduction in August 2020, the programme has helped over 300 patients like Mdm Sumiah.20.         Working in teams and establishing collaborations across institutions has enabled these initiatives to come to fruition. My deepest appreciation to all 9,000 healthcare professionals and partners from 41 participating institutions, for your resourcefulness, innovativeness, resilience. and perseverance.21.         My heartiest congratulations to all Award Winners this afternoon. As the saying goes, ""one may be overpowered, two can defend themselves, but a cord of three is not quickly broken"". The cord of three represents MOH, our healthcare providers as well as our beneficiaries - our patients. With strong partnership and trust amongst us, I am confident we will emerge from this long-drawn pandemic battle, victorious, and bring our healthcare system to even greater heights. Last but not least, I wish everybody a good Chinese New Year and Year of the Tiger ahead. Today is the 8th day of February 2022, so I wish everyone good luck, prosperity and good health.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-singapore-health-quality-service-awards-2022,

I am very pleased to join all of you today to mark the official launch of the Temasek Foundation Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Immunisation Programme, in partnership with the Singapore Cancer Society (SCS). 2.             While Singapore continues to battle COVID-19 on the frontline, I am heartened that the pandemic has not detracted from ongoing efforts to combat other viruses such as HPV. Today’s event is an example to reach out to women about HPV vaccination and cervical cancer, through the Temasek Foundation HPV Immunisation Programme.     HPV vaccination and prevention of cervical cancer 3.             Almost all instances of cervical cancer can be attributed to HPV infection – more than 95 per cent of cervical cancer cases worldwide are a result of the virus1. In Singapore, cervical cancer is the 10th most common cancer and also the 10th most common cause of cancer deaths among Singaporean women2, as attributed by Mr Wee earlier. However, it is also one of the most preventable cancers among women and can also be effectively treated, if detected early. 4.             The HPV vaccine significantly reduces a woman’s risk of developing cervical cancer. Studies have shown that getting vaccinated earlier in life also provides better protection against the disease. Completing the HPV vaccination and going for regular cervical cancer screening are key to cervical cancer prevention. Positive Results from National Programmes5.             The Ministry of Health (MOH) has embarked on various initiatives to improve uptake of the HPV vaccine. The national school-based HPV vaccination programme was rolled out in 2019 to vaccinate female secondary school students. Since then, more than 90% of Secondary One female students in various cohorts have received their HPV vaccinations. Female Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who fall under the recommended age group for HPV vaccination are also eligible for subsidies under the national immunisation schedules. 6.             However there remains a lack of awareness and uptake in some population groups. Today’s launch demonstrates the importance of the government and community partnerships in advancing public health and wellness and augmenting existing national efforts. Launch of the Temasek Foundation HPV Immunisation Programme 7.             Funded by Temasek Foundation, this new programme will be helmed and implemented by SCS and seeks to cover the out-of-pocket costs for each HPV vaccine dose for women from low-income backgrounds. This will greatly increase the accessibility of the HPV vaccine by removing cost barriers associated with the vaccination and will go a long way towards improving vaccine uptake in this group. 8.             Through such collaborations that seek to educate individuals and facilitate their access to potentially life-saving vaccinations, we can better empower women to take ownership of their own health. Other efforts for the early detection of cervical cancer 9.             Besides vaccination, screening is also key to the early detection of cervical cancer. Early detection and treatment particularly in its pre-cancerous stages can be lifesaving. 10.          Since 2017, the Health Promotion Board’s national Screen For Life (SFL) programme has provided subsidised cervical cancer screening at Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) General Practitioners so that all eligible Singaporeans can go for their recommended health screenings and follow-up. To this end, SCS has been offering subsidised cervical cancer screening at their clinic in Bishan, and actively reaching out to young girls to educate them on HPV and cervical cancer. I encourage every eligible woman to make the most of such initiatives to protect their health. Closing11.          In closing, I want to thank SCS for being MOH’s key partner in promoting cancer awareness and prevention through their public education and community outreach efforts, and Temasek Foundation for its continued support for programmes that seek to build social resilience in Singapore. 12.           I would also like to express my gratitude to all agencies and partners for the invaluable support provided to make this HPV Immunisation Programme a reality despite the challenges posed by the ongoing pandemic. I am confident that this new partnership will go a long way towards boosting the uptake of HPV vaccination in Singaporean women. Together, we can #JabOutHPV! 13.          Thank you.[1] Source: Factsheet on cervical cancer, published by the World Health Organization on 20 Jan 22.[2] Source: Singapore Cancer Registry Annual Report 2018, published by the National Registry of Diseases Office on 31 Mar 21.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-ms-rahayu-mahzam-parliamentary-secretary-ministry-of-health-at-the-official-launch-of-the-temasek-foundation-hpv-immunisation-programme-in-partnership-with-singapore-cancer-society-10-february-2022-2.30pm,

I also want to thank all the board members of the Campus for giving guidance, leadership and direction, under the leadership of Ms Jennie Chua for this project.  2               We want to thank all our Advisers here for supporting this and giving constructive feedback so that we can make this campus better to serve the residents of the North. And also all our workers, everyone – engineers, architects, technicians, draftsman, everyone who was involved. I know it is not an easy project and a very big one. And thank you all for five years of hard work. Couple more years to go. 3               We should acknowledge the challenges that this project has gone through because it went right into the COVID-19 pandemic which delayed a lot of things. Notwithstanding that, we try to work together and help each other out as much as possible. I don’t want to underestimate the challenges the contractors have to go through. But I think it is all in our interest now to pull through and make sure this project is a success. 4               There is obviously some delay due to COVID-19 because it went through the Circuit Breaker. But as of now, based on the schedule, by end of 2023, we should be able to open part of the campus, starting in phases. At the beginning, it will be part of the Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOC) as well as the nursing home. And it will open in phases after that. I am sure this will be state-of-the-art. This will be a campus that we can all be proud of in Singapore, as Singaporeans but also as residents and Advisers of the North. 5               This is just one of many projects. Since I became Health Minister, I have opened a polyclinic. I just opened the SingHealth Tower, which has a new community hospital as well as a day hospice centre and now this – not opening but at least we are topping up and hoisting a beam. You are going to see more and more infrastructure coming up. 6               The government is spending a lot and investing in healthcare infrastructure. When these infrastructures open, they are not just concrete. You need doctors, nurses and healthcare workers to operate. All these require a lot of resources. All this is needed because of the inexorable trend that our population is ageing. Over the last 10 years, our healthcare expenditure tripled. The next 10 years, we do expect it to triple again, just mostly driven by the fact that as a population we are growing old, and we know that as we become old, this is when we fall sick, and need medical care. This is when the government needs to come in to subsidise medical care in order for our people to be able to access affordable and quality healthcare. That is why healthcare expenditure is going up.  7               Of course, investing in healthcare capacity and manpower is one thing. We need to do another very important set of action, which is how do we prevent this generation of Singaporeans in their middle age from getting serious chronic diseases 10 years from now? In fact, how do we prevent people of all our ages, while we are still healthy, from getting seriously ill? If we can do that successfully, I think we can really moderate the increase of healthcare costs. We should not let it triple in 10 years because that is the current trajectory based on today's trends. 8               Preventive healthcare is going to be very important because if we can prevent chronic diseases and severe diseases, we will age much more gracefully, with much better quality of life. The burden on our family will be much less, the entire healthcare system will be much more sustainable, and our whole nation's fiscal position will be more sustainable. So this will be a very key area of priority for the Ministry of Health in this coming term. I will speak about it more as we move into the annual season of Budget debate and Committee of Supply. 9               But the imperative is – let's have a Healthier Singapore. Let's have a Healthier SG. That needs to be a key priority. And we will again require everyone to chip in and do our part. 10            Last but not least, thank you very much. I wish you good health in the Year of the Tiger. ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/remarks-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-woodlands-health-campus-topping-out-event-12-february-2022,

Services and programmes will also be run to encourage social interaction among residents.We plan to launch more community care apartments. At the same time, as this is a new concept, we will study these pilots and make adjustments before firming up longer-term plans. We are also looking at ways to catalyse private sector-led models of assisted living, with plans for a pilot under way.Beyond housing options, MOH has also put in place support structures and services for seniors. We help seniors who are well to stay active and healthy through various active ageing programmes.The eldercare centres nationwide serve as convenient go-to points for all seniors and address their health, psychosocial and care needs. Seniors with higher care needs can be referred to the appropriate care services, such as home care or centre-based care.Frail seniors residing at nursing homes are provided with recreational facilities and activities to keep them meaningfully engaged.Providers are also using technology more to support their residents' socio-emotional needs, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. One example of that is helping residents connect with their loved ones via video-conferencing. Residents also enjoy virtual activities such as online programmes organised by partners like the National Heritage Board and Mandai Wildlife Reserves.Planning for ageing is a continuous journey, and we will work closely with our partners to meet the evolving needs of current and future seniors.Ho Weng SiDirector (Successful Ageing)Ministry of Health",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/housing-options-support-structures-services-put-in-place-for-seniors-to-age-in-place,

The hospitals’ Emergency Departments have similarly received many patients who are not in need of emergency medical assistance. These visits are not necessary, and risk compromising the standard of care for those who genuinely require medical attention.3.             From tomorrow, these individuals can do their supervised self-administered ART at CTCs and QTCs located island-wide. We will start with 48 centres, and ramp up to about 205 by the end of the week. These supervised self-administered ARTs will be fully funded by the Government for these 4 weeks. 4.             The ART test results will be updated in MOH’s record and reflected in their HealthHub within about 30 minutes. The CTCs and QTCs will not issue recovery memos or medical certificates as these are not required by employees and students to return to work or school.  5.             Persons will be notified of their ART test result over SMS. Upon testing positive on the supervised self-administered ART, these persons will be placed under Protocol 2 and can each collect three ART kits from vending machines [2]. Under today’s health protocols, they are to self-isolate at home for at least 72 hours, and should visit a GP clinic only if they feel unwell. Once they feel well and test negative on their self-administered ART, they may exit isolation to resume normal activities. 6.             Members of the public can book their supervised self-administered ART at https://go.gov.sg/community-ART-test. 7.             We seek everyone’s continued effort and cooperation to do our part to preserve our medical resources for those who are in need. MINISTRY OF HEALTH15 FEBRUARY 2022[1] To be further reviewed for extension.[2] Visit gowhere.gov.sg/art for the vending machine locations.Locations of Combined Test Centres and Quick Test Centres",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/supervised-self-administered-antigen-rapid-test-available-at-test-centres_15Feb2022,

This is within our expectations, given the high transmissibility of Omicron. However, our high vaccination and booster rates, along with vaccination-differentiated Safe Management Measures (SMMs), have been effective in keeping the number of severe cases low, and our healthcare capacity available to treat the severely ill currently remains sufficient. 2.  In the coming weeks, daily case numbers may rise even further before peaking, and may remain moderately high for some time before coming down. We will continue to closely monitor the capacity of our healthcare system, and prepare for further surges in infections. During this period, our strategy remains to safeguard our healthcare capacity and focus resources on managing severe cases and protecting vulnerable patients. In line with this, we will continue to suspend in-person visits to hospitals and residential care homes for an additional four weeks.3.  We will also further simplify our existing healthcare protocols, workplace testing requirements, and SMMs, so that everyone can understand the rules, focus on the measures that matter, and do our part in making sure our measures remain effective:a.  More age groups of patients to be managed by primary care physicians under Protocol 2 if they exhibit mild symptoms; b.  Shorter monitoring duration and simplified testing requirements for those under Protocol 3 (i.e. close contacts of COVID-19 cases); c.  Focusing the Mandatory Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) on sectors where there are interactions with vulnerable population as well as the provision of essential services; d.  Streamlining the SMMs to a set of five core parameters, so that it will be easier for everyone to comply with them on a daily basis; and e.  Simplifying our country/region classification and streamlining our border testing measures given the reduced impact of imported cases4.  These measures will allow us to respond nimbly to changes in the pandemic situation in the coming months, including to  ease measures when the Omicron wave eventually subside, or tighten up should there be another unknown new variant. Updates on Local Situation5.  Over the past week, daily case numbers have remained high, at an average of around 11,000 cases. The large majority of our cases continue to have mild or no symptoms. The number of cases which are hospitalised is around 1,400, of which about 30% are ‘incidental cases’, (i.e. they were hospitalised due to other illness but subsequently tested to be COVID-19 positive).  Meanwhile, hospitals are also increasing bed capacity to care for severe COVID-19 cases, while ensuring that care for non-COVID-19 patients are not compromised. About 70 of our hospitalised patients are children under 12 years old. The infection rates for children aged 0 to 4 years and those aged 5 to 11 years are currently high at about 243 and 258 per 100,000 population respectively. Individuals aged 12 to 19 years have the highest infection rate of about 269 per 100,000 population.6.  Aside from standing up more beds for children in our public and private hospitals, we are also actively converting beds in our COVID-19 Treatment Facilities for children and their caregivers. The proportion of severe COVID-19 infections and Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children associated with COVID-19 infection (MIS-C) cases is around 1 out of 1,000 paediatric infection cases. Vaccination of children will help lower the risk of such episodes. 7.  The overall situation in our healthcare system remains stable. 23 cases are currently in ICU care, and 140 require oxygen supplementation. In the past 28 days, 0.04% and 0.3% of local cases required ICU care or oxygen supplementation respectively. Continued Efforts to Safeguard our Healthcare System and Right-Site PatientsExtended Suspension of In-Person Visits to Hospitals and Residential Care Homes 8.  We had previously suspended in-person visits to all hospital wards[1] and residential care homes (‘Homes’) for a period of four weeks through to 20 February 2022. As it remains crucial that we protect our healthcare capacity and vulnerable groups, the suspension of in-persons visits will be extended for a further four weeks, from 21 February to 20 March 2022 (both dates inclusive), with a mid-point review after two weeks. Hospitals and Homes have the discretion to allow visits for exceptional cases (e.g. if the patient or resident is critically ill). These visitors will continue to be subject to visitor management measures (see Annex A for details). Hospitals and Homes will also continue to support alternative methods of communication such as through telephone or video calls to ensure that patients and residents remain connected with their loved ones. In-situ Recovery for Selected Nursing Home Residents9.  Currently, nursing home residents infected with COVID-19 are moved from the nursing homes to recover at separate care facilities. However, the majority of Omicron cases in nursing homes were mildly symptomatic and generally did not require the level of medical care provided at hospitals or dedicated COVID-19 care facilities. Also, moving away from a familiar environment can be distressing to nursing home residents and disruptive to their holistic care. Hence, from 16 February 2022, the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) will progressively support nursing homes to care for their fully vaccinated COVID-19 residents who are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic within their premises, but isolated from the other uninfected residents. This will allow generally well residents with COVID-19 infection to recover safely under the care of their nursing home provider who is also most familiar with their needs. Residents assessed to be at higher risk, or who show signs of clinical deterioration, will continue to be conveyed to an appropriate care facility for further management.Revised Healthcare Protocols Expanded Application of Protocol 2 to More Patient Groups10.  Among patients infected since January 2022, the vast majority from most age groups have mild symptoms and can recover safely on their own. Even amongst the seniors, the incidence of severe illnesses have been low.  For example, amongst seniors aged 60 to 69 years who were infected, only about 0.5% of fully vaccinated and 1.8% of non-fully vaccinated patients were treated as severe cases. Amongst vaccinated seniors aged 70 to 79 years, 1.2% fell severely ill after being infected. 4.5% of 3 to 4-year olds who attended Emergency Departments (EDs) required admission and less than 1% of them on Home Recovery Programme were escalated to the telemedicine providers for further management.11.  Hence, from 16 February 2022, all patients aged 3 to 69 years, regardless of vaccination status, and fully vaccinated[2] patients aged 70 to 79 years old can be managed by their primary care doctors under Protocol 2[3]. This is an expansion of the current age band, which applies to fully vaccinated patients aged 5 to 69 years, and non-fully vaccinated patients aged 5 to 49 years. Patients falling outside of these age brackets will continue to be managed by MOH, either through the Home Recovery Programme or at a care facility such as a COVID-19 Treatment Facility or a hospital. This will further right-site the care of COVID-19 patients and ensure that our healthcare capacity is preserved for those who require acute care. A summary of the revised management approach for COVID-19 patients for different age groups is in Annex B.12.  With the above changes, individuals under Protocol 2 with non-emergency conditions, including children, are strongly advised to avoid seeking treatment at the EDs of hospitals and to consult their primary care doctors or telemedicine providers should they require any medical assistance. Individuals with non-emergency conditions turning up at EDs may be diverted to other urgent care clinics for further assessment, so as to prioritise ED resources for patients requiring acute care. Individuals may also be diverted for admission to COVID-19 Treatment Facilities for further monitoring of their medical condition, as long as they do not require hospitalisation.Changes to Protocol 3 for Close Contacts 13.  Currently, close contacts of positive cases identified by MOH (i.e. under Protocol 1 or Protocol 2 managed by primary care doctors) are placed on Protocol 3. These individuals are issued with a Health Risk Warning (HRW) lasting 7 days from the day of its issuance, with an ART-based daily self-testing regime imposed should they wish to leave their place of residence. However, close contacts of cases who self-test positive (i.e. under Protocol 2) are not able to be identified and are thus not issued the HRW.  14.  Therefore from 18 February 2022, we will introduce two key changes to Protocol 3.  First, it will be changed from an order to an advisory, with the Health Risk Notice (HRN) replacing the Health Risk Warning (HRW) for close contacts identified by MOH under Protocol 3.  Persons issued with HRN can continue to obtain their ART test kits through designated vending machines, to facilitate their self-testing during the monitoring period[4].  Second, the recommended self-monitoring period will be reduced from 7 days to 5 days, as individuals infected with the Omicron variant have been shown to have a shorter incubation period. That said, those who have already received HRWs should still complete their existing monitoring periods[5].  15.  Regardless of whether one receives a HRN from MOH, all persons who are aware of their recent exposure to a case should be socially responsible and follow Protocol 3. They should moderate their social activities, monitor their health and self-test with ART before leaving home for that day, especially if they are going to crowded places or are coming into contact with vulnerable individuals.Streamlining the Rostered Routine Testing Regime 16.  Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) was first introduced in dormitories and higher risk workplaces in August 2020. Over time, we have expanded it to cover more higher-risk work settings[6], and shifted towards an ART-based RRT. 17.  The RRT regime had served as an important part of our strategy to facilitate early detection and containment of transmission in the community. Testing continues to be an essential response to COVID-19. However, we are in a different situation today and our testing strategy needs to evolve. Our high vaccination coverage and the implementation of Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs (VDS) offer good protection to the workforce from severe disease due to COVID-19 infection. The high transmissibility and shorter incubation period of the Omicron variant have also meant a reduction in the effectiveness of RRT in containing community transmission. Furthermore, we have shifted our focus towards protecting the vulnerable population and managing severe cases.18.  Therefore, from 18 February 2022, we will streamline the RRT regime to focus only on settings catering to vulnerable groups (i.e. healthcare sector, eldercare sector, and settings with children below 5 years old[7]) and selected essential services sectors[8],[9]. Other sectors which are currently on RRT will no longer be required to continue testing from 18 February 2022.19.  Even as we move to streamline RRT to those in vulnerable settings, we urge individuals to continue to exercise personal responsibility and conduct regular self-testing, especially prior to visiting crowded places or interacting with vulnerable groups during this period. Companies that have remaining kits that were already distributed to them for RRT are strongly encouraged to continue testing until the test kits are fully utilised.Updates on Community Safe Management Measures 20.  As we continue to transition to a COVID-19 resilient nation, we will simplify and rationalise our COVID-19 rules, which have accumulated over time and become overly complex.  21.  This rationalisation and simplification is important. Responding to COVID-19 requires everyone to do their part. We can facilitate this by making rules less complicated and burdensome to remember. This will also lay the foundation for us to resume normal activities once the Omicron wave peaks and starts to subside. 22.  We will rationalise the SMMs to focus on the five most important and effective measures, making them simpler to understand and comply with:  a.  Group sizes;b.  Mask-wearing;c.  Workplace requirements;d.  Safe distancing; ande.  Capacity limits.23.  From 25 February 2022 (unless otherwise stated below), we will implement the following streamlined SMMs (see Annex C). More details are provided in the sections as follows. Group Sizes24.  For now, the permissible group size for social gatherings remains at 5 persons. The maximum number of unique visitors per household will be adjusted from 5 persons per day, to 5 persons at any one time.  Mask-Wearing25.  Mask-wearing will continue to be required as a default. There are no new exceptions. Workplace Requirements26.  We will maintain the current posture of allowing up to 50% of employees who can work from home to return to the office. As part of the streamlining of rules, workplace requirements will now be aligned with those for the community SMMs. For instance, workers who have their masks on will not need to maintain 1 metre safe distancing in the workplace. Social gatherings at workplaces will be allowed to resume with up to 5 persons for each social gathering. There will be no restrictions on cross-deployment of employees across workplaces, although employers may continue to do so for business continuity reasons. Safe Distancing27.  Safe distancing is encouraged but will not be required between individuals or  groups in all mask-on settings. Safe distancing will continue to be required for all mask-off settings. Where safe distancing is required, the distance will be streamlined to a single safe distance of 1 metre for all settings.Capacity Limits 28.  Instead of fixing size limits for various event types, we will move to setting event sizes based on the capacity of the venue. Hence, from 4 March 2022, we will lift specific event size limits for events such as religious services, business events, media conferences, funerary memorial events, wedding receptions, and mask-on classes[10].  Zoning requirements will also be removed, as the main protection is through masks and vaccinations.  29.  However, for large events and settings which pose more infection risks, we will impose capacity limits, as a precaution. These will include attractions, cruises, MICE and large work-related events, as well as large performing arts venues or sports stadiums. For other settings such as shopping malls and large standalone stores, the current density limit of 10sqm/pax roughly translates to 50% capacity too. For now, we will set the threshold at 1,000 pax. This means that:a.  For smaller settings/events with ≤1,000 pax, they can proceed without being subject to any capacity limit.  b.  For larger settings/events with >1,000 pax and are mask-on[11], they would be subject to a capacity limit of 50%. For mask-off events, they would be required to comply with the 1 metre safe distancing requirement and prevailing group size, which will already serve to limit capacity.See Annex D for the list of settings/events covered.Adjustments to VDS30.  From 25 February 2022, unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in 2010 or later) need not be from the same household to be included within a group entering premises or participating in activities with VDS.Resuming Sports 31.  The main driver of COVID-19 transmission has been prolonged close contact with infected persons, such as when eating together. There has been no compelling evidence showing that transient contact while playing sports leads to infections.  Conversely, two years of SMMs have taken its toll on the physical, emotional and mental well-being of our people, especially the young. 32.  With the rationalisation of SMMs, from 25 February 2022, all sports will be allowed to proceed with up to 30 fully vaccinated persons (including players, coaches, umpires etc) , at supervised/operated sports facilities (e.g. ActiveSG facilities and approved private facilities). The prevailing SMMs will apply before and after the sport activity, and during rest breaks. No additional testing requirement will be imposed as long as all participants are fully vaccinated, but participants are strongly encouraged to self-test before arriving for the sports activity, and to stay home if they test positive or develop symptoms. 33.  For all the updates on community SMMs above, relevant agencies will provide more details on the requirements specific to their sector.Updates to Border MeasuresStreamlining of Country/Region Classification and Border Measures34.  To date, our border measures such as pre-departure testing and Stay-Home Notice (SHN) had been aimed at controlling the number of imported cases. As Singapore’s incidence rate is now comparable with most overseas destinations, imported cases are unlikely to affect the trajectory of local cases. Our focus has thus shifted to facilitating inflows from travellers who are less likely to become severely ill and burden our healthcare capacity while they are in Singapore. As vaccination offers good protection against severe disease, we will continue to work towards allowing SHN-free travel for all fully vaccinated travellers.  35.  To better position ourselves to do so, we will begin by streamlining the country/region classification. The existing Categories II, III, and IV will be combined into a single General Travel category. Fully vaccinated travellers arriving via Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) arrangements can continue to enjoy quarantine-free border measures. For now, all travellers from Category I countries/regions, which have very low infection rates, will continue to enjoy quarantine-free travel arrangements as well[12]. We will also create a new Restrictedcategory for countries/regions with developing COVID-19 situations that warrant stricter border measures imposed on arrivals. Under our revised classification, we would start with no Restricted countries/regions.36.  In tandem, we will simplify border measures for travellers arriving from 21 February 2022, 2359 hours, as follows: a.  Travel history requirement will be reduced from 14 to 7 days; b.  SHN duration will be standardised to 7 days across all country/region categories in view of Omicron’s shorter incubation period; c.  Enhanced testing regime for travellers arriving on VTLs will be ceased;d.  VTL and Category I travellers will no longer need to perform an on-arrival PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) test.  Instead, they will have up to 24 hours from their entry into Singapore to take a supervised self-swab (SSS) ART[13] at one of the testing centres located across Singapore; ande.  Vaccinated Long-Term Pass Holders (except Work Permit holders) will no longer have to obtain a Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) or an Entry Approval to enter Singapore. They will still need to adhere to border health measures on entry. Please refer to Annex E for more details.    f.  To further facilitate vaccinated travel, we will restore and progressively increase VTL quotas. VTL (Air) quotas will be fully restored with immediate effect. VTL (Land) quotas will be fully restored from 22 February 2022 (sales for additional bus tickets will commence on 16 February 2022).  Restoring and Expanding Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTL)37.  A new VTL with Hong Kong and the previously deferred VTLs with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) will also be launched. VTP applications for travel from these four countries/regions will open on 22 February 2022, 1000 hours, and the first VTL flights will take place from 25 February 2022. We will progressively launch VTLs with more destinations as we move towards facilitating fully vaccinated travel. 38.  Bi-directional quarantine-free sea travel between Singapore and Indonesia will resume with the launch of VTL (Sea) from Bintan and Batam. The VTL (Sea) will benefit users of Indonesia’s travel bubble to specific resorts in Bintan and Batam and facilitate short-term leisure travel. VTP applications will open on 22 February 2022, 1000 hours, and the first ferry trip will take place on 25 February 2022. 39.  The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), Ministry of Trade & Industry (MTI) and Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) will provide further details for VTL(Air), VTL(Land) and VTL(Sea) respectively. We will continue to monitor the global COVID-19 situation and adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID-resilient nation.40.  The updated classification and associated border requirements can be found in Annex F and on the SafeTravel website. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures for the associated country or region before entering Singapore, and be prepared to adhere to the prevailing border measures upon entry into Singapore.Riding through the Omicron Wave41.  Our current measures serve as important safeguards to protect our healthcare system during this period as we continue to lead our daily lives normally. To ride out this wave safely, it remains key that we get our vaccination and booster doses promptly when offered, comply with existing safe management measures, and exercise personal responsibility to self-test before visiting crowded places or interacting with vulnerable groups such as seniors or children. Those who are tested positive should follow the latest health protocols. Patients should refrain from seeking medical attention at the EDs if they have only mild symptoms, so that EDs can focus on taking care of acutely ill patients. Only then can we emerge stronger to resume our transition towards safe re-opening and living with COVID-19.MINISTRY OF HEALTH 16 FEBRUARY 2022 [1] Includes public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals.[2] Individuals may check whether they are considered “fully vaccinated” at https://go.gov.sg/vax-status-query.[3] Those who test ART positive at non-clinical settings (e.g. unsupervised self-swab or supervised self-swab by test providers in non-clinical settings) but who belong to at-risk groups visit a doctor for medical advice even if they feel well. The list of at-risk groups can be found in Annex B.[4] For the healthcare, eldercare, and preschool sectors, additional requirements may be put in place for close contacts to protect the vulnerable individuals in these settings.[5] Individuals issued with HRWs prior to 18 February 2022 will be required to complete their monitoring period and testing requirements under the current HRW protocol.[6] Those currently on RRT includes: border frontline workers, COVID-19 frontline workers, staff interacting with vulnerable population (e.g. healthcare/eldercare workers, children aged below 12 years old), dorm-dwelling workers, Construction, Marine and Process workers, staff in dine-in F&B establishments, personal care services, gyms and fitness studios, retail mall and supermarket staff, last-mile delivery workers (including parcel and food delivery personnel), public and private transport workers, and workers in essential services.[7] This includes staff as well as third-party vendors in preschools, Early Intervention centres, and Private Education Institutions with children less than 5 years old.[8] Sectors which will continue on RRT as essential services will be informed by their respective Sector Lead agencies via sector-specific communication channels at a later date. [9]  Sectors may choose to continue using the existing Swab Registration System (SRS) to upload their RRT test results. They may also onboard businesses onto “Sync”, a new platform launched this week by Open Government Products that enables individuals to easily declare their self-swab results and provide consent for sharing ART and PCR test results and vaccination statuses with organisations and employers. Companies can be onboarded to Sync via sync.gov.sg.[10] These refer to events held outside the home. For home solemnisations, there can be up to 10 attendees or 5 non-resident visitors (whichever is higher).  For home funerals, the current arrangement of up to 30 attendees remains. Refer to the relevant sectoral advisories for more details.[11] For example, for a 1,200 pax event, the event would need to be held at a venue which accommodates 2,400 pax, or the event size would have to be capped at 1,000 pax. Events where 1m safe distancing and group size limits apply will not be subject to the 50% capacity limit, as the SMMs already ensure spreading out of attendees.[12]Taking into account recent developments in Hong Kong’s COVID-19 situation, we will reclassify Hong Kong to the General Travel category with effect from 24 February 2022, 2359 hours. To minimise disruptions to vaccinated travellers, we will concurrently launch a VTL with Hong Kong (please see para 38 for details).  [13] Travellers should visit Quick Test Centres (QTCs) or Combined Test Centres (CTCs) for their OAT SSS ART. The weblink to book tests at QTCs or CTCs will be provided in the Testing Notice issued to travellers upon their entry into Singapore . Travellers should self-isolate prior to receiving the OAT test result and use private transport when going to the testing site. If you feel unwell, please visit a clinic for medical advice via private transport.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/resetting-our-measures-to-live-with-the-omicron-variant_16Feb2022,

Hospitals, polyclinics and General Practitioner (GP) clinics are very busy, and healthcare workers are under severe pressure. It may take a few weeks before the transmission wave peaks and subsides.Supporting Hospitals2. This has resulted in two problems. First, while the number of patients needing oxygen supplementation and intensive care unit (ICU) care is not high, there is a surge in demand for hospital beds, mostly for patients with underlying chronic illnesses to recover.3. The Ministry of Health (MOH) is doing whatever we can to support our healthcare providers. These include ramping up capacity in our hospitals, right-siting patients at COVID-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs) as much as possible, spreading patient load to private hospitals, allowing residents in nursing homes to recover in-situ and supplementing our healthcare manpower with the SG Healthcare Corps as well as Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) medics. We have also further adjusted our health protocols to allow more patients to be able to recover at home.Assistance from Employers4. Second, many patients coming forward to hospitals, polyclinics and GP clinics have no or mild symptoms. They would like to get an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) conducted by a medical professional and documented in MOH’s records, or to request for a medical certificate. This has added significant workload to our healthcare providers who are already under significant pressure and stress.5. Our healthcare service providers will need help and cooperation from employers and members of the public. We urge employers not to insist that employees provide medical certificates or recovery memos if they have tested positive for COVID-19. They are encouraged to remind employees who are at low risk and have mild symptoms or are physically well to isolate and recover at home instead of visiting clinics or hospitals. They can submit a photograph of their test results or a video of them taking the ART.Do not rush to Emergency Department if it is not an emergency6. For the public, we encourage individuals that unless they are experiencing an emergency, not to rush to a hospital emergency department (ED). Patients who walk into EDs with non-emergency conditions, including children, may be diverted to other urgent care clinics or primary care clinics for further assessment, so as to prioritise ED resources for patients who need the medical care.Alternatives for Medical Attention7. For those who require medical attention, we encourage them to consult a primary care doctor first. To help spread out peak patient load at private clinics, we will extend the operating hours of Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) with effect from 25 February 2022 to 10 March 2022 (inclusive). Selected PHPCs across the island will operate weekday nights (up to 11pm), weekend afternoons (Saturdays and Sundays, 2pm to 5pm), and weekend nights (Saturdays and Sundays, up to 11pm). Selected polyclinics will also be operating on Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings. Please visit flu.gowhere.gov.sg for the list of clinics providing these time-limited extended hours.8. From 26 February 2022, the Combined Test Centres (CTCs) will provide access to telemedicine consultations for symptomatic members of the public who go to CTCs for testing during the weekends. The telemedicine doctors will be able to provide face-to-face video consultations, and prescribe and deliver medications if need be. The testing and consultations will be funded by the Government during this period. The booking of Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) testing and telemedicine consultation appointment at the CTCs can be made at go.gov.sg/ari-weekend-testing.9. Individuals can also approach MOH-approved telemedicine providers to consult a doctor virtually. These telemedicine providers are able to provide both tele-consults and administer a tele-ART (i.e. real-time virtually supervised ART self-swab). For a list of telemedicine providers who are able to provide such services, please go to www.flu.gowhere.gov.sg.Self-Recovery under Protocol 210. Importantly, we encourage those who have mild or no symptoms but tested positive, to consider self-recovery at home, under Protocol 2.11. Individuals require an official record for various reasons. The first is to be exempted from Rostered Routine Testing (RRT), if they work in certain industries. However, we will be stepping down RRT for most industries, except for the healthcare, eldercare, and pre-school sectors. The second is for the individual to prove that he was previously infected, should he be tested PCR positive when he travels. However, we are also stepping down PCR test for travellers.12. The third is to be exempted from a booster shot. While a fully-vaccinated individual who has been infected with COVID-19 is exempted from a booster shot, we encourage such individuals to still take their booster dose, in order to be adequately protected against the COVID-19 virus.13. The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) recommends that these individuals may receive a booster dose 28 days after infection, although they are recommended to do so three months from the infection for better effectiveness. Our vaccination centres have therefore been administering booster shots to persons who are due to receive a booster, 28 days after infection. So those who have been infected do not have to wait three months. This means that most infected and recovered individuals can take their booster shots well within the 270 days after their primary series, and before their fully vaccinated status lapses.Everyone has a part to play 14.

The Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) and the Ministry of Health (MOH) urge members of the public to only call 995 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) for life-threatening emergencies1.2. 995 EMS calls to SCDF have increased from an average of 635 calls a day in January 2022 to an average of 830 calls a day in the first two weeks of February 2022. On 14 February 2022, SCDF experienced an even sharper spike to about 1,000 calls. This has added significant stress on our paramedics who are already under significant pressure. In comparison, the average daily number of EMS calls before COVID-19 was only about 550.3. Approximately 1,700 calls in January 2022 and about 2,500 calls in the first two weeks of February 2022 were from COVID-19 patients. However, about 45% of them only needed day treatment at the hospital and did not need to be hospitalised.4. SCDF 995 EMS are meant to provide swift conveyance to hospital for people with life-threatening and emergency medical conditions. They need to be prioritised for such. Hence, we appeal to individuals who are not suffering any life-threatening or emergency medical conditions2 to refrain from calling 995. If EMS calls continue to climb, the public may experience delays in ambulance response even for medical emergencies.5. In the first two weeks of February 2022, our public hospitals saw a high number of patients at their ED, an average of about 3,100 a day, resulting in long queues and waiting times. This is an increase of about 15% compared to January. Up to 80% of these patients needed only day treatment at the ED and did not need to be hospitalised. If many patients with non-emergency conditions turn up at the ED, it could compromise the provision of emergency medical care for those who really require it. We urge the public to seek medical treatment at a hospital’s ED only for serious or life-threatening emergencies.6. MOH and SCDF have worked together to streamline the triaging and conveyance of COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients who are stable and do not require any management of acute emergency symptoms, will be conveyed by SCDF to a COVID-19 Treatment Facility (CTF) directly if they are assessed to require further medical monitoring and management of non-emergency medical conditions. This direct conveyance will begin with the CTF at NTUC Health Nursing Home at Tampines from 26 February 2022.7. Individuals who are under the Home Recovery Programme or awaiting conveyance to a care or isolation facility, and who are experiencing only mild symptoms, are advised to first seek medical help via the following channels, rather than to call 995 or walk into EDs:a. A telemedicine provider (go.gov.sg/telemedicineproviders); b. Their regular primary care provider; or c. The HR Buddy hotline (6874 4939).8. Those who have self-tested positive on a self-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) and have no or mild symptoms, should simply self-isolate at home, for at least 72 hours. If really necessary, they can book an appointment at any Combined Test Centre (CTC) or Quick Test Centre (QTC) to do a supervised self-administered ART. If they are feeling unwell or experiencing symptoms such as fever or persistent cough, they can visit a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) via private transport for medical attention. The public may access the latest list of General Practitioner (GP) clinics and their operating hours at:• MOH website• The Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC) website;• Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) webpage; and• HealthHub mobile application, which is available on both the App Store and the Google Play Store.9. As we transit to living with COVID-19, appropriate and prudent use of 995 EMS and ED services are important. It will ensure that patients truly requiring emergency medical care are able to receive it in a timely manner.[1] These conditions include sudden onset of chest pain, breathlessness, drowsiness or confusion, sudden onset of limb or body weakness, difficulty in speech, or drooping of the face, severe bleeding from injuries, loss of consciousness, and unexplained jerking of the body or fits.[2] Non-life threatening conditions include cases such as bone fracture, cuts with bleeding and accidents with bruising or swelling.SINGAPORE CIVIL DEFENCE FORCE MINISTRY OF HEALTH",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/covid-19-patients-to-please-make-use-of-scdf-emergency-medical-services-and-emergency-department-services-prudently,

MOH is unable to ascertain the reasons for them not getting their boosters, but indications are that many of them are overseas.As for the Singaporeans who are not boosted, the majority are seniors aged 60 years and above. A common reason for not getting booster jabs is that they seldom go out, they feel they are adequately protected with their primary vaccination and they prefer to delay their booster vaccination.MOH will continue to encourage individuals to come forward and take their booster shots when they are eligible, using SMS reminders, making vaccination as convenient as possible, and also importantly, deploying our Mobile Vaccination Teams to the heartlands to reach out especially to the seniors.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/lapsed-vaccination-status,

Bragassam felt that medical certificates (MCs) are still needed from employees infected by Covid-19.   The insistence by some employers for MCs from workers who had self-tested positive for Covid-19 has contributed to many patients, with mild or no symptoms, making unnecessary visits to general practitioner clinics, polyclinics and hospitals' emergency departments mainly to obtain an MC.   This adds workload to healthcare workers who are already under stress, and it compromises the standard of care for other patients who genuinely require medical care.   Our tripartite partners - the Singapore National Employers Federation and the National Trades Union Congress - agree that a photograph of a positive antigen rapid test (ART) result or a video of the worker taking the ART should suffice.   Should they really require an official record, they may ask their workers to undergo a supervised ART at one of the combined test centres or quick test centres islandwide.   These tests will be fully funded by the Government until March 15, and the result will be reflected in one's HealthHub status within 30 minutes. An SMS notification will also be sent, which can be used as documentary proof of past infection.   No worker wishes to fall ill. In fact, having been infected once and recovered, they will be less susceptible to another Covid-19 episode.   This means the firms' workforce will eventually become more resilient along with the rest of society.     Then Yee Thoong Divisional DirectorLabour Relations and Workplaces DivisionMinistry of Manpower Dinesh Vasu Dash Group DirectorCrisis Strategy and Operations GroupMinistry of Health",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/if-employer-really-requires-official-record-worker-can-take-supervised-art,

On 15 October 2021, MOH issued a media statement to call out these websites and platforms and to debunk the misinformation found there. On 24 October 2021, a Correction Direction order was also issued to the “Truth Warriors” website for false statements of fact and misleading information relating to COVID-19 treatments. Various subsequent clarifications and facts have also been published by the Government, and MOH and HSA have proactively put up consumer advisories on their websites to increase public awareness.From February 2020 to January 2022, HSA detected and directed the removal of 740 listings of pharmaceutical agents on e-commerce platforms and social media apps claiming to be effective in preventing or treating COVID-19. More than 150 sellers were issued with a stern warning.Sellers who falsely advertise pharmaceutical products as being able to prevent or treat COVID-19 are liable to prosecution and if convicted, may be imprisoned for up to 12 months and/or fined up to $20,000 under the Health Products Act. Individuals who bring in such pharmaceutical products and distribute them for use without a doctor’s prescription, with the intent to treat COVID-19, can be taken to task as unlicensed medical practitioners under the Medical Registration Act.

We will progressively build up its coverage to include information from more healthcare providers to support care continuity.A common pharmacy system for the three public healthcare clusters is underway, to allow consolidation of patient information, which allows providers to have a more holistic view of patients’ medications and facilitate the filling of prescriptions. In addition, MOH and the clusters are also developing a national charging and billing system to streamline processes and enable a more consistent experience for patients.Common digital services across the clusters, such as the scheduling of appointments and bill payments are available on the national HealthHub mobile app and web portal. HealthHub also displays personal health records drawn from national systems, including, for example, COVID-19 vaccination records and COVID-19 test results. These common services are also made available through the clusters’ apps. This reduces the duplication of development effort and facilitate consistent user experience, regardless of the platform a person uses to connect with our healthcare system. Meanwhile, the presence of healthcare cluster-specific applications enable those healthcare providers to customise features tailored to their specific facilities and services, and also to innovate on user-interaction features that could better engage their patients. Over time, some of these new innovations that are well-received and successful in engaging patients can be incorporated as common services that are then made available to all patients in their preferred platform, be it HealthHub or one of the cluster apps.We will continue to improve our digital services and enhance our offerings to improve the user experience.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/improve-information-sharing-and-integration-of-processes_4Mar2022,

For those healthcare workers that are not covered by the Employment Act, their rest day provisions and work hour limits are set out in the public healthcare clusters’ employment contracts.   COVID-19 has stretched our healthcare resources and placed a heavy burden on our healthcare staff. All our public healthcare workers have been working doubly hard during this time of crisis. Whenever there is essential and urgent need that requires overtime work, employers will accord overtime pay as required by Section 38 of the Act. We urge cooperation and understanding from everyone as the hospitals reduced non-urgent and non-life-threatening care treatments to manage the current workload, decant those who need less intensive care to Community Treatment Facilities and curtailed visitations to hospitals.

However, surveys such as the National Population Health Survey have shown that the proportion of seniors aged 60-74 years with poor mental health was 11.4% in 2017 and 9.4% in 2020. The second Well-being of Singapore Elderly study is under way and we will continue to track and better meet the mental health needs of our seniors. As there is inconclusive evidence on benefits of mass mental health screening, efforts are focused instead on increasing mental health literacy and awareness, as well as identifying and providing support to persons at risk or suspected to have mental health conditions in the community. In the past two years, the community outreach teams have reached out and provided information and/or assistance to more than 128,000 people. To complement the above, our Eldercare Centres (ECs) work with the Silver Generation Office (SGO) to proactively reach out to vulnerable seniors who have no or limited social support. Seniors identified to require care and support are referred to the appropriate care services, such as befriending and mental health services. MOH will continue to work closely with our partners to develop community resources and build their capabilities to better support the mental health and well-being of the population.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/seniors-who-have-required-mental-health-intervention-given-social-isolation-in-last-two-years-due-to-covid-19-pandemic,

So they do pose a significant load on our healthcare resources.d.    Therefore, VDS is still necessary to protect the unvaccinated and prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.e.    Once the Omicron wave has subsided, we will be in a better position to ease our measures further.6.     COVID-19 therapeutics was mentioned by Ms Sylvia Lim, and indeed they have been authorised by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA), but I must explain that they are meant to mitigate the risk of progression to severe illness from COVID-19 infection, whereas vaccination serves as a more preventive role, to go further upstream to prevent COVID-19 infection and not allowing severe illnesses to take place in the first place. Therapeutics are therefore complementary and are not substitutes to vaccination.7.     Let me share some data, which is actually quite compelling. Non-fully vaccinated adults infected with the Omicron variant – which supposedly is milder than Delta – are up to:a.  18 times more likely to require ICU care; andb.  38 times more likely to die from COVID-19 infection, compared to vaccinated and boosted adults.8.     In fact, we see that the unvaccinated children between zero to 11 years old are at risk of Multi-System Inflammation Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) that some of you may have read about in the newspapers as well. The incidence in an unvaccinated child can be as high as 470 cases per million infections.9.     Even for the adult population, of all age groups, an unvaccinated person is at risk of one in 10 chance, of getting long-COVD after a COVID-19 infection, and it has been proven time and again, that vaccination can reduce this risk significantly. So, vaccination is still key in keeping us safe, both at a personal level, and at a systems level.Simplification of Safe Management Measures (SMMs)10.     Mr Yip also sought clarification on the rationalisation of SMMs that the Multi-Ministry Taskforce recently announced and whether they can be further simplified. In fact, as explained, this rationalisation is itself a way to simplify the SMMs into just five key parameters. It makes it easier for the public to understand. In the coming weeks, as we see the cases continue to show a sustained decline, we can then further ease measures along these key parameters.11.     I note Mr Yip has actually filed a Parliamentary Question on the restrictions at coffee shops and canteens. I seek the member’s understanding that My colleagues at the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment will look into this and address it at a subsequent sitting.Basis of Extension of Part 7 and Review for Fitness for Purpose12.     Mr Yip asked if we might consider a shorter period of extension of Part 7 and base the extension on specific indicators. Ms Sylvia Lim also mentioned that the control measures should be constantly reviewed for their efficacy and make sure that they are fitness for purpose. I agree with her.13.     In fact, we monitor the weekly infection growth rate, the R number, as an indicator of virus transmissibility, as well as other matrices like mortality rate, hospital occupancy and our healthcare manpower.14.     But each variant, as we have seen in the past two years, has somewhat different characteristics and slightly different behaviour, compared to each other. Therefore, no single set of parameters can be solely relied upon and we have to remain nimble and take all factors into account in designing any of these restrictions.15.     As mentioned in my opening speech, we take a calibrated approach in the control measures and have made progressive adjustments to the SMMs as the COVID-19 situation evolves.16.     Members will certainly recall that when the pandemic first started, we actually went into a Circuit Breaker and subsequently, a series of Heightened Alert Phases, as we cautiously, gradually, try to reopen social and economic activities to manage the infection risks in our largely unvaccinated population at the time.17.     With good progress in our national vaccination efforts towards the end of 2021, our collective resilience, immunity, and defence against the virus was strengthened so we were able to ride through the wave of Delta infection without resorting to a Circuit Breaker again. Therefore we have calibrated some of the measures in dealing with this virus as our whole situation evolves.18.     When the current Omicron wave hit us, our population had achieved a high vaccination and booster rate, allowing us to then continue on with our progressive reopening, and our move towards endemicity without further tightening of restrictions19.     Such a move would have been unthinkable one and a half years ago, and our healthcare system at the time would have been overwhelmed, if the same numbers of daily infections were to be seen at that point.20.     This clearly attests to the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines and the trust and unity of our people in responding to the call to get vaccinated and boosted.21.     Our adjustments to Protocols 1, 2, 3 and the maintenance of some SMMs have allowed us to ride through this wave currently, without causing our healthcare system to collapse.22.     Like Members, I too, hope that we can eventually dispense with the restrictions.23.     In a best-case scenario where COVID-19 ceases to be a threat before the end of 12 months, regulations that are no longer relevant can be repealed and Part 7 can be allowed to lapse.24.     In the opposite scenario, if a variant that can cause more severe illness takes hold, the regulations under Part 7 will continue to be important for the protection of public health.Conclusion25.     A one-year extension will provide the flexibility for us to adjust and calibrate COVID-19 measures accordingly.26.     I thank Members for their support of this amendment.Mr Speaker, I beg to move.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/closing-speech-for-second-reading-of-the-covid-19-(temporary-measures)-(amendment)-bill-by-senior-minister-of-state-for-health-dr-koh-poh-koon,

Similarly, individuals aged 12 to 17 years may now walk in to any VC offering the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine to receive their primary vaccination series and booster dose. Individuals aged 18 years and above may walk into any VC offering mRNA vaccines to receive their primary vaccination series and booster dose. Update on Paediatric Vaccination for Children Aged Between 5 and 11 3.         As of 13 March 2022, about a quarter million children aged between 5 to 11 have signed up for COVID-19 vaccination. 444,000 doses have been administered, with 248,000 children receiving at least their first dose, while 196,000 have received their second dose. Among the students in our primary schools, 83% have received at least their first dose, while 69% have received both doses. In addition, over 29,000 children born in 2016 and 2017 have registered on the Ministry of Health’s National Appointment System. 28,000 have received at least their first dose, while 17,000 have received their second dose. 4.             For the convenience of parents/guardians of children who may have missed their second dose appointment, they can re-book their second dose vaccination appointment or walk in with their child/ward to the same paediatric VC2 where the child received their first dose on any day before 7pm3 to complete the vaccination. Should the paediatric VC no longer be in operation4, parents/guardians may bring their child/ward to any paediatric VCs for their second dose. We strongly encourage children to complete both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. 5.        We seek the understanding and cooperation of parents/guardians to keep to the stipulated hours for the walk-in arrangement, so that we can provide a smooth and orderly vaccination process for all our children. Parents/guardians should release any prior bookings made, if they vaccinate their child/ward under the walk-in arrangement. 6.             All children aged 5 to 11 must also be accompanied by one parent/guardian at the VC for their vaccination. On the day of the vaccination, parents/guardians should bring along Student Identification, or if not available, other forms of identification (e.g. Birth Certificate/Passport/SingPass) for verification. Parents/guardians will also be required to bring a signed hard or soft copy of the parental consent form, which can be downloaded at https://go.gov.sg/parcf. 7.           Children who have an official record of their COVID-19 infection would be considered fully vaccinated after receiving a single dose of the vaccine post-infection. Children who had recovered from COVID-19 and have yet to complete their primary vaccination series are recommended to receive a single dose of the vaccine at least three months after the date of their infection to complete their vaccination. Children who tested positive on a self-administered antigen rapid test (ART), or via ARTs not done at an approved test provider, would not have an official record of his/her infection. These children would need to receive two doses of the vaccine to be considered fully vaccinated. It is safe for them to do so. Update on Booster Doses for Individuals Aged 12 and Above 8.           As of 15 March 2022, 70% of the total population have received their booster dose. 9.             The Ministry of Health and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination had previously recommended for all persons aged 12 years and above to receive a booster dose of mRNA vaccine offered under the National Vaccination Programme five months after completing their primary vaccination series. They are considered fully vaccinated for 270 days after the last dose of their primary vaccination series, and will require a booster dose to maintain their vaccinated status thereafter. 10.          Persons who have recovered from COVID-19 infection and completed the recommended COVID-19 vaccination may receive a booster vaccination. It is safe for them to do so. They may receive the booster dose 28 days after infection, although they are recommended to do so three months from the infection and around five months after the last dose of their primary vaccination series (whichever is later) for better effectiveness. 11.          Individuals aged 12 to 17 will require the consent of their parent/guardian to receive the booster dose, and should bring along their Student Identification, or if not available, other forms of identification (e.g. Birth Certificate/Passport/SingPass) for verification purposes. All children aged 12 to 17 will also be required to bring a signed hard or soft copy of the parental consent form, which can be downloaded at https://go.gov.sg/parcf. Parents/guardians of children aged 13 and above are not required to accompany them on the day of vaccination. However, children aged 12 will need to be accompanied by a parent/guardian, as per the arrangements for the primary vaccination series. 12.          We invite individuals and parents/guardians to take full advantage of the capacity and good geographical spread of our VCs, before more VCs are closed down in the coming weeks.

The HPB board is currently finalising the appointment of his successor, and this will be announced in due course. In the meantime, Mr Koh Peng Keng, who is currently the Chief Operating Officer (COO) of HPB, will be appointed as Interim CEO until the new CEO comes onboard. 2.   During his nine years as CEO of HPB, Mr Zee has accomplished several breakthroughs across the promotional, regulatory and technology domains for HPB. Under his leadership, HPB increased the share of Healthier Choice Symbol products among packaged foods purchased by consumers. The uptake of HPB’s Screen for Life programme for disease prevention and follow-up rate increased significantly over the years. During his tenure, HPB also forged numerous partnerships with agencies in both the public and private sectors, which have contributed to the increase in the overall physical activity level for Singaporeans.3.   Mr Zee also drove and advocated the use of technology and new capabilities to further HPB’s work. An example is the National Steps Challenge™, which is into its sixth season. Across the past five seasons, since 2015, the Challenge has attracted over 1.7 million participants, encouraging Singaporeans to walk more and keep active.  In the fight against COVID-19, Mr Zee led HPB to help build and scale up national testing operations to support Singapore’s testing strategy. 4.   As COO, Mr Koh plays a key role in driving the integration and end-to-end planning and execution of HPB’s health promotion and disease prevention programmes. He was also the Group Director of the Testing Operations Task Group in HPB prior to his appointment as COO, where he led the national swab and testing operations for COVID-19. Mr Koh joined the Civil Service in 1985 and held various key positions in the Singapore Armed Forces and Ministries such as the Ministry of Community Development, Youth and Sports, Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth and Ministry of Health. 5.   Mr Philip Lee, Chairman of HPB said, “Yoong Kang has been a focal point in promoting health initiatives in Singapore.  He steered HPB in the use of technologies, data analytics as well as behavioural insights in designing programmes for government healthcare initiatives such as, the National Steps ChallengeTM programme, Live Healthy SG initiative and LumiHealth mobile application.  He also led HPB in driving initiatives for mental well-being campaigns like ‘Hi #JustCheckingIn’ and ‘It’s OKAY to Reach Out’  to normalise talking about mental health issues and to equip Singaporeans with the skills needed to support their families and friends. His dedication and leadership will be missed. We wish him all the best in his new role.6.   The Ministry of Health and HPB wish to express their deep appreciation to Mr Zee Yoong Kang for his contributions.MINISTRY OF HEALTHHEALTH PROMOTION BOARD17 MARCH 2022",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/appointment-of-interim-ceo-for-health-promotion-board_17Mar2022,

This was done with a view of simplifying and streamlining the rules, thus enabling us to ease the SMMs along these five parameters, once there was an improvement in our overall healthcare situation.  2.             Thanks to the collective efforts of everyone in Singapore, the daily local case numbers and the number of COVID-19 related hospitalisations have declined steadily. While the workload of our healthcare workers remains high with the increase in non-COVID-19 admissions, our overall conditions have improved significantly. We are now in a position to make a significant move to ease our community SMMs, and make further progress towards living with COVID-19. 3.             In tandem with the easing of community SMMs, we will also facilitate the resumption of travel by transiting to a Vaccinated Travel framework, where all fully vaccinated travellers can enjoy quarantine-free entry into Singapore without the need to enter under specific Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs). 4.             Even as we move towards normalcy, it is necessary to adequately protect vulnerable segments in our society who are at higher risk of falling severely ill from COVID-19. As such, we have accepted the recommendation by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) to offer a second booster dose to persons aged 80 years and above, residents of aged care facilities, as well as medically vulnerable persons with co-morbidities. These groups are most affected by waning vaccine efficacy over time. The second booster dose should be taken five months after receiving their first booster dose. Updates on the Local Situation 5.             Daily case numbers and COVID-19 hospitalisations have continued to decline steadily in the past week. The 7-day moving average of daily case numbers has fallen from around 13,000 to under 10,000. More importantly, the number of hospitalisations has fallen from 1,238 to 951. Incidence of severe illness has also remained low. In the past 28 days, 0.04% and 0.3% of local cases required ICU care or oxygen supplementation respectively. Updates on Community SMMs 6.             The SMM 1-5 framework consists of five key parameters: (i) group sizes; (ii) mask-wearing; (iii) workplace requirements; (iv) safe distancing; and (v) capacity limits. As the local situation has improved considerably, we will ease the community SMMs along these five parameters.  From 29 March 2022, we will implement the following adjustments (see Annex A for more details): a.    Group Sizes. The permissible group size for social gatherings will be increased from 5 persons to 10 persons for mask-off activities. The maximum number of unique visitors per household will also be adjusted from 5 persons at any one time, to 10 persons at any one time. b.    Mask-Wearing. Mask-wearing will continue to be required for indoor settings when people leave their homes, but will be optional in outdoor settings. However, we encourage individuals to wear their masks even when outdoors for personal protection and to protect others, especially in crowded areas. Indoor places refer to all buildings/places with clearly defined entrances/exits, such as office buildings, shopping malls, public transport (i.e. when commuting in trains and buses), and includes hawker centres and coffeeshops. Places which are sheltered but with open access generally, such as Housing Development Board (HDB) void decks, retail block walkways, bus stops, and naturally ventilated bus interchanges will be regarded as outdoor areas. See Annex B for more examples. c.     Workplace Requirements. Up to 75% of employees who are able to work from home can now return to the workplace, an increase from the current limit of 50%. We will continue to align the rules for social gatherings in workplaces and other social settings, so long as the general group size and masking rules are adhered to. d.    Safe Distancing. Safe distancing continues to be encouraged but will not be required between individuals or groups for mask-on settings. A safe distance of 1 metre will continue to be required for mask-off settings. between individuals or between groups up to the prevailing group size limit. Notwithstanding this, we still need to guard against gatherings of big crowds, even if they have their masks on. Hence, we will continue to impose capacity limits, as described below. e.    Capacity Limits. The capacity limit of 50% for large events and settings of more than 1,000 pax1 will be increased to 75%. This means that:                                      i.     For smaller settings/events with ≤1,000 pax, they can proceed without being subject to any capacity limit.                                    ii.     For larger settings/events with >1,000 pax and that are mask-on2, they will be subject to operating within 75% of the capacity limit of the venue. For mask-off events, individuals or groups of individuals up to the prevailing group size will be required to comply with the 1 metre safe distancing requirement.See Annex C for the list of settings/events covered.  Other Activity-Specific Adjustments 7.             In line with the above easing under the SMM 1-5 framework, we will also make the following activity-specific adjustments from 29 March 2022. 8.             Dine-in at food and beverage (F&B) establishments. In line with the increase in group size, groups of up to 10 fully vaccinated persons will be allowed to dine-in at F&B establishments, including hawker centres and coffee shops, where full vaccination-differentiated SMMs (VDS) checks have been implemented at their entrances. To ease the operational burden for F&B operators, we will allow all F&B establishments to seat smaller groups of up to 5 fully vaccinated persons, without the need for full VDS checks at their entrance. Instead, random spot-checks will be done to ensure that only vaccinated persons are dining-in at these places, and the onus will be on the dining-in individuals to abide by the rules. This will make it easier for the F&B operators who face difficulties in cordoning off their venues and setting up discrete access control points especially hawker centres and coffee-shops. 9.             Alcohol consumption. The current restriction, in F&B establishments, on the sale and consumption of alcohol after 10.30pm will be lifted. 10.          Live performances and screening of programmes. Live performances will be allowed to resume at all venues, including F&B establishments. Outdoor live performances and busking3 will also be allowed to resume.  Groups that are involved in the performances will have to comply with the prevailing SMM 1-5, i.e. keep to the group size of 10 unmasked persons. We will also lift the restriction on the screening of live broadcast programmes and recorded entertainment in F&B establishments. 11.          Vocalisation activities. We had previously taken a strong position against group vocalisation activities because of the higher risk of transmission. But we are now in a different situation and can start easing this restriction. Subject to masks being worn throughout the vocalisation activity, we will allow the following activities which involve vocalisation by large groups:a.    Congregational singing and chanting;b.    Cheering by audiences/spectators/participants at events; andc.     Singing in general settings, including in schools. 12.          Social events and larger-scale social gatherings. Except for marriage solemnisations and wedding receptions, which are key life events, we have held back from allowing larger-scale social gatherings and events such as gala dinners, corporate dinner-and-dance events (D&Ds), birthday celebrations and anniversaries.  Given the stabilising local situation and for consistency with other events, we will allow such social events and gatherings to resume. Organisers of these events should still comply the prevailing SMM 1-5. That means there should be no more than 10 persons per table, and safe distancing of 1 m maintained between tables. Participants should also continue to exercise prudence and restraint, and limit their interactions to the same group they are seated with. 13.          The above changes will all take effect from 29 March 2022. The relevant agencies will provide more details on any further detailed requirements specific to their sectors. 14.          We are separately looking into the safe resumption of nightlife businesses, comprising bars, pubs, karaoke establishments, discotheques and nightclubs. These are activities with much higher risks of transmission and where there are generally more difficulties complying with the prevailing SMM 1-5. MTI and MHA will provide an update on the re-opening of the sector in the coming weeks. Supporting Literacy and Learning for Young Children 15.          Currently, children aged 6 years and above are required to wear a mask when they leave their homes, while children younger than 6 are strongly encouraged to mask up when there is interaction with others. While this affords young children protection against COVID-19 infection, it may also make it more challenging for them, especially those with listening or learning difficulties, to develop language and literacy skills. In line with the national transition towards COVID-19 resiliency, the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) will offer selected groups of teachers and students in schools, preschools and Early Intervention Centres the flexibility to remove their masks during language and literacy lessons to better support children’s learning and development needs. These groups include children with hearing loss, speech articulation issues, or learning difficulties such as dyslexia. MOE and ECDA will share details. Rationalisation of SMMs for Migrant Workers (MWs) living in Dormitories 16.          The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will also align the SMMs for MWs living in dormitories with the latest community SMMs. 17.          In addition, from 1 April 2022, vaccinated MWs will no longer need to apply for Exit Passes to visit recreation centres (RCs). Only unvaccinated MWs must continue to apply for Exit Passes and also fulfil their pre-visit ART before visiting the RCs. For community visits, we earlier increased the quota of community visit slots for vaccinated MWs from 3,000 on weekdays, and 6,000 for weekends and public holidays to 15,000 and 30,000 respectively. This quota will remain the same, but there will no longer be a need to do pre-visit ART. To safeguard unvaccinated MWs against infection, they would still not be allowed to visit the community. Cessation of Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) Regime 18.          As part of our shift in focus towards protecting the vulnerable and in view of the reduced effectiveness of RRT in containing the Omicron variant given its shorter incubation period and higher transmissibility, we had earlier streamlined RRT to apply only to settings catering to vulnerable groups and selected essential services sectors. 19.          As the COVID-19 situation eases, we will optimise our testing strategy further. The high vaccination and booster coverage among the sectors still on RRT, and their strict compliance to their specific safe management measures are sufficient to protect the individuals within these sectors, now that we have passed the peak of the Omicron wave. Therefore, from 29 March 2022, we will stop RRT for all sectors4. With this, the Government subsidies provided for companies on RRT will also end on 29 March 2022. Employers and businesses who wish to impose regular testing at the workplace at their cost may continue to do so. Individuals are still encouraged to self-test when they feel unwell or had recent contact with an infected person, and to follow the necessary health protocols if they test positive. Companies should continue to allow their employees to rest at home from their COVID infection if they test positive, without the need for a medical certificate or recovery memo. Expanding Protocol 2 to Paediatric COVID-19 Patients aged 12 months to 2 years old 20.          We had earlier allowed patients aged 3 to 69 years to recover at home under Protocol 2 regardless of vaccination status, as the vast majority of people in this age group can recover safely on their own. Local clinical data collected during the Omicron wave indicates that most children in the 12 months to 2 years old age group also experience mild symptoms and recover uneventfully in the community. Hence, in consultation with the paediatric specialist community, MOH will now expand the eligible age band. From 25 March 2022, patients aged 12 months to 2 years old will also be managed under Protocol 2 by default, either at home or under the care of their primary care physicians or paediatricians. See Annex D for the revised default management of COVID-19 patients across all age groups. Move to Vaccinated Travel Framework 21.          Over the past few months, we have simplified our country/region classification and border measures to pave the way for more Vaccinated Travel. With many countries/regions having passed the peak of their Omicron wave and our local COVID-19 situation stabilising, we are ready to launch the Vaccinated Travel Framework for all travellers including Short-Term Visitors (STVs). We will classify all countries/regions either under the General Travel or the Restricted Category and accord border measures by individual travellers’ vaccination status. All countries/regions will come under the General Travel Category to begin with. There are no countries/regions in the Restricted Category currently. General Travel Category Border Measures 22.          From 31 March 2022, 2359 hours, the border measures for travellers arriving via air or sea checkpoints from countries/regions in the General Travel Category will be as follows: a.    All fully vaccinated travellers5 and non-fully vaccinated children aged 12 and below6 are permitted to enter Singapore. They will not need to apply for entry approvals or take designated VTL transport. They will continue to be subjected to a pre-departure test (PDT) within 2 days before departure for Singapore, but will no longer be required to serve a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) or undergo an unsupervised Antigen Rapid Test (ART) after arriving in Singapore. We will continue to monitor the local and global COVID-19 situations and consider removing the PDT requirement in the coming weeks; b.    Non-fully vaccinated Long-Term Pass Holders (LTPHs) and STVs aged 13 and above are generally not allowed to enter Singapore, with the following exceptions (i) LTPHs medically ineligible for vaccines ; (ii) LTPHs aged 13 to 17, subject to the appropriate measures7 and (iii) LTPHs and STVs with other valid entry approval (e.g. for compassionate reasons). They are required to take a PDT within 2 days before departure for Singapore, undergo a 7-day SHN, and take a PCR test at the end of their SHN period.  23.          To facilitate Singapore Citizens (SCs), Permanent Residents (PRs), Work Pass Holders and other LTPHs who may face difficulties obtaining valid PDTs within 2 days before returning to Singapore, we have introduced remote supervised ART services by approved licensed providers in Singapore for such travellers arriving from selected countries. Going forward, we will accept Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests, professionally administered ARTs and ARTs supervised by approved licensed providers in Singapore (including remotely supervised ARTs) taken within 2 days before departure for Singapore as valid PDTs. Travellers who wish to use the remotely supervised ART PDT services licensed in Singapore should book their slots early with these providers via their respective websites and bring along approved ART kits from Singapore for their remotely supervised ART. Refer to https://go.gov.sg/remote-art-overseas-sg for a list of approved remotely supervised ART PDT providers, and the travellers and countries/regions that this service applies to. 24.          We are also working towards the full resumption of land travel with Malaysia for fully vaccinated persons. Details on the exact border measures for fully vaccinated travellers entering Singapore via the land borders will be announced jointly with Malaysia. Restricted Category Border Measures 25.          In the event of a new variant with potentially significant public health risk, we may re-classify significantly affected countries/regions under the Restricted Category with stringent border measures, such as the need for entry approvals for STVs to enter Singapore. This is to enable us to limit the risk of importing new and potentially dangerous variants if they arise, as well as to buy time for experts to better understand the characteristics of these variants and to develop appropriate public health recommendations.8 26.          See Annex E for details on the border measures for travellers arriving from 31 March 2022, 2359 hours. The latest border requirements can be found on the SafeTravel website. Travellers are strongly advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures before entering Singapore, and be prepared to adhere to the prevailing border measures upon entry into Singapore. Updates to Charging Policies for Vaccinated Travellers 27.          Currently, SCs/PRs/LTPH travellers are responsible for medical bills in hospitals and dedicated COVID-19 treatment and recovery facilities, if they develop onset of symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of their return to Singapore. With the introduction of the Vaccinated Travel Framework, we will streamline our charging policies for travellers as follows: a.    The charging policy for SCs/PRs/LTPH travellers who are subjected to General Travel Category border measures will be aligned with the prevailing charging policy for treatment of local community COVID-19 cases (i.e. non-travellers). This means that such travellers who have been fully vaccinated9 will no longer be required to pay for medical bills incurred for COVID-19 treatment in hospitals and CTFs, even if they develop onset of symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 within 14 days of their return to Singapore. Any future changes to the charging policy for local community cases will correspondingly apply to this group of travellers. Travellers who are not fully vaccinated will remain responsible for their COVID-19 treatment costs, as per the charging policy for unvaccinated individuals who contracted COVID-19 in the community. b.    SCs/PRs/LTPH travellers who are subjected to Restricted Category border measures, will be required to pay for medical bills in hospitals and dedicated COVID-19 treatment and recovery facilities, if they develop onset of symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 within 7 days of their return to Singapore, regardless of their vaccination status. 28.          The above measures will apply to all new admissions from henceforth. Patients who are to pay for their medical bills may continue to tap on their regular healthcare financing arrangements to help pay for their bills.10 For avoidance of doubt, there is no change to the charging policy for Short Term Pass Holders, who remain responsible for any COVID-19 medical bill incurred, throughout their stay in Singapore. Updates on Vaccination Progress and Closure of Vaccination Centres 29.          As of 22 March 2022, over 92% of our population have completed their primary series vaccinations and 71% have received their booster doses. The paediatric vaccination exercise for children aged between 5 to 11 years old has also progressed well with over 76% of the eligible population having taken at least their first dose, including about 85% of our primary school students. Hence, the number of doses administered have reduced steadily over the past weeks. 30.          In view of that, MOH will progressively step down the number of Vaccination Centres (VC), starting from end-April 2022, and free up these space for other uses. a.    Marine Parade Community Club (CC) will cease operations on 30 April 2022 while Woodlands CC and Nee Soon East CC’s last day of operation will be on 31 May 2022. Marine Parade CC will administer the last Dose 1 on 9 April 2022 and continue to administer Dose 2/booster doses until 30 April 2022. Woodlands CC and Nee Soon East CC will administer the last Dose 1 on 2 May 2022 and 10 May 2022 respectively. Both CCs will continue to administer Dose 2/booster doses until 31 May 2022. b.    There are currently 13 paediatric VCs, and 12 will remain operational until end-April 2022.11 From May to July 2022, MOH plans to reduce the number of paediatric VCs from 12 to 2, as most of the 5 to 11 years old would have completed their primary series vaccinations. MOH will progressively onboard selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics and Polyclinics to provide paediatric vaccine doses to children who have yet to receive their primary series vaccination. Further details will be announced at a later date. Second Booster Dose for Persons Aged 80 and Above and the Medically Vulnerable 31.          Given emerging international data on the waning of vaccine protection against severe disease with time, EC19V has recommended a second booster dose for persons who are medically susceptible to severe COVID-19. This will help ensure that these at-risk groups remain highly protected as we resume normal activities. MOH agrees with EC19V’s recommendation for the following groups to receive a second booster dose, around five months after receiving their first booster dose: a.    All persons aged 80 years and above; b.    Persons living in aged care facilities, such as nursing homes; and c.     Medically vulnerable persons who are at increased risk of severe disease due to significant medical risk factors12. 32.          The recommendation for persons belonging to these at-risk groups to receive a second booster dose will not affect their vaccination status for VDS. They are strongly encouraged to go for the second booster to protect themselves. More details on how at-risk groups can receive their second booster dose will be announced later. 33.           There are currently no recommendations from the EC19V for healthy persons in younger age groups to receive a second booster dose, as they have better immune responses to vaccination and are at lower risks of severe disease. Towards COVID-19 Resilience 34.          The stabilisation of our local COVID-19 situation has allowed us to the ease our community SMMs and border measures. We have crossed the peak of the recent wave because of the hard work and sacrifices of our healthcare workers, and our collective efforts in adhering to SMMs and health protocols. However, we will need to stay vigilant. As we relax our SMM and travel postures, it will be even more important for everyone in Singapore to stay disciplined in our fight against COVID-19, by adhering to the prevailing SMMs and following the appropriate health protocols, so as to avoid a resurgence of hospitalisation and severe illness, which could slow or even undo our progress towards gradual resumption. By working together, we can look forward to achieving COVID-19 resiliency as a nation.MINISTRY OF HEALTH24 MARCH 2022 [1] Large events and settings include attractions, cruises, MICE and large work-related events, as well as large performing arts venues and sports stadiums. For other settings such as shopping malls and large standalone stores, the density limit of 7 sqm/pax roughly translates to 75% capacity.[2] For example, for a 1,200 pax event, the event would need to be held at a venue which accommodates 1,600 pax, otherwise the event size would have to be capped at 1,000 pax. Events where 1m safe distancing and group size limits apply will not be subject to the 75% capacity limit, as the SMMs already ensure spreading out of attendees and the lowering of risk through mask-wearing.[3] Busking will resume per the National Arts Council (NAC) Busking Scheme. Please refer to the NAC website for details.[4] This includes settings with children below 5 years old (e.g. preschools, Early Intervention Centres, and private education institutions). Data continues to show that COVID-19 is a mild disease in children. For Omicron, 0.018% of cases aged 0-4 years old and 0.013% of unvaccinated cases aged 5-11 years old had illness requiring oxygen supplementation or ICU care. There were no fully vaccinated cases aged 5-11 years old with severe illness.[5] This includes Short-Term Visitors (STVs) and Work Permit Holders (WPH) such as Migrant Domestic Workers (MDWs) and existing CMP WPHs holding issued work permits who will no longer need to serve their SHN at the Onboard centres. Non-Malaysian WPHs holding an In-Principle Approval (IPA) in the Construction, Marine Shipyard and Process (CMP) sectors will still be required to meet the Ministry of Manpower(MOM)’s entry requirements which include obtaining entry approvals from MOM, pending further review and until MOM announces any changes. Please refer to MOM website for details.[6] To illustrate, for 2022, non-fully vaccinated children born in or after 2010 may enter Singapore using the protocols for fully vaccinated travellers.[7] Non-fully vaccinated LTPHs aged 13 – 17 years may enter Singapore without needing to apply for entry approval, subject to a 7-day SHN at their declared place of accommodation and exit-SHN PCR test. They should also complete the full vaccination regime after arriving in Singapore.[8] There are currently no Restricted Category countries/regions. Travellers with travel history to Restricted Category countries/regions in the last 7 days will be required to take pre-departure and on-arrival PCR tests. They will have to serve their 7-day SHN in a dedicated facility and be required to test negative on a PCR test before exiting their SHN.[9] This includes those who have been medically exempted from COVID-19 vaccination, and children aged 12 years and below (based on year of birth).[10] Patients may tap on regular healthcare financing arrangements to help pay for these bills – for SC/PRs, this includes Government subsidies and MediShield Life/Integrated Shield Plan (MSHL/IP) coverage. For LTPHs, this refers to any usual financing arrangements they may have, such as private insurance.[11] The paediatric VC at Yusof Ishak Secondary School (VC@YISS) will cease operations on 1 April 2022. The 12 paediatric VCs are located at Clementi CC, Former Hong Kah Secondary School, Hougang CC, Jalan Besar CC, Marine Parade CC, Nee Soon CC, Our Tampines Hub, Pasir Ris Elias CC, Woodlands Galaxy CC, Senja-Cashew CC, The Serangoon CC and Toa Payoh West CC.[12] Vulnerable persons may receive a fourth dose as recommended by their doctors. Vulnerable persons are individuals who are at increased risk of severe disease due to significant medical risk factors. These include persons with chronic diseases of the heart, lungs, kidneys, liver and other organ systems.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/easing-of-community-smms-and-border-measures,

As the daily number of local COVID-19 cases has fallen, and the situation in our hospitals and Homes is starting to improve, in-person visits to hospital wards and Homes will resume from 4 April 2022. 3.     As hospitals and Homes are settings with vulnerable patients/residents, visitors will have to comply with the safe management measures (SMMs) to better protect the patient/resident. 4.     In-person visits are only allowed for individuals (i.e. patients, residents and visitors) who are fully vaccinated. As a concession, we will allow visits for individuals (i.e. patients, residents and visitors) who are medically ineligible for COVID-19 vaccination. Under exceptional circumstances, hospitals and Homes may also exercise flexibility in their visitor policies on a case-by-case basis. More details can be found in the Annex. 5.     We understand the past months have been difficult for patients/residents, and their family members and loved ones as in-person visits were suspended, and thank everyone for their understanding. We seek their continued cooperation to comply with the SMMs to keep patients/ residents safe as in-person visits are resumed.

I would also like to offer my deepest condolences to the family for their tragic loss. The couple has had discussions with the NUH team and the matter has since been closed between the two parties. The family had put up a social media post recently acknowledging this, and further acknowledged that the mother had not been left unattended for two hours. Indeed, she received attention and care from the NUH Emergency Department (ED) team from the time she arrived. They further noted that the sad, unfortunate outcome of the pregnancy was not the result of her experience at the hospital. Out of respect for the couple’s request for privacy, and for confidentiality reasons, I will not go into details of the case.3     NUH has investigated the matter thoroughly and reviewed their processes, in consultation with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Director, Medical Services. Their clinical care processes are appropriate, but there were some areas for improved communications and the coordination of transfers between the ED and the Delivery Suite. NUH has implemented these improvements.4     COVID-19 has resulted in the public hospitals EDs facing very high demands and our healthcare workers have been working continuously to attend to all patients, with COVID-19 and those with non-COVID-19 conditions. All patients will be triaged based on presenting history, symptoms, and clinical parameters so that those with life-threatening conditions are prioritised. No patient will be denied care.5     I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all healthcare workers for their professionalism and dedication in caring for all their patients.

As a result, we can deliver quality healthcare that is affordable and sustainable over the long term. 3               More than 20 years ago, we identified sustained investment in R&D as a key pillar of Singapore’s economic development strategy. The Government hence launched the biomedical sciences initiative, to build up the biomedical industry as the fourth pillar of the economy.  Our emphasis is not just blue skies research, but also applied clinical research. 4               With this, improvement in healthcare delivery system and R&D investment in the advancement of medical science become complementary and strategic initiatives, to create economic opportunities and strengthen healthcare capabilities for the benefit of our people in Singapore. CRIS 5               Over the years, by sustaining this approach, we build up scientific excellence, robust infrastructure, a pipeline of talent for biomedical research, development of commercial enterprises and projects. 6               Set up in 2020, CRIS plays an important role in shepherding all our biomedical initiatives.  It has been bringing together various national level R&D initiatives and clinical services, establishing them as business units, and facilitating synergistic collaboration between them. Today, let me highlight some of the good work achieved by the various business units. Singapore Clinical Research Institute 7               First, the Singapore Clinical Research Institute (SCRI). It is the longest established entity within CRIS since 2008, supporting clinical trials for researchers. 8               SCRI has introduced and proliferated leading-edge capabilities in clinical research. One such example is REDCAP, a secure web-based application, which supports data capture for research studies. It is now widely used by our clinician researchers at our local hospitals. 9               When COVID-19 emerged in Singapore in 2020, these capabilities were put to good use. SCRI supported the National Centre for Infectious Diseases in several clinical trials of anti-COVID medications like Eli Lilly’s antibody cocktail and small molecule antivirals like Remdesivir. By conducting these trials locally, severely ill COVID-19 patients had early access to the medicines. The data generated from these trials also contributed towards the prompt global registration of these life-saving drugs. 10            Looking ahead, SCRI will continue to play a role in growing our clinical research capabilities. It is now working with a local medical start-up to testbed a patient-matching platform that could significantly enhance the initiation, screening and enrolment of patients into oncology trials. Public healthcare investigators will gain access to a larger, cross-institutional patient pool for oncology trials. National Health Innovation Centre Singapore 11            Next is the National Health Innovation Centre Singapore (NHIC), established in 2014. Its role is to translate innovation into commercial enterprises and products. 12            An example of a game changing medtech product, which NHIC supported, is the SELENA+, Singapore Eye Lesion Analyser. The existing model of screening for diabetic retinopathy is resource intensive and time consuming, requiring manual examination of patients’ retinal images. 13            A team of researchers from the Singapore Eye Research Institute and the NUS School of Computing then developed SELENA+, which uses Artificial Intelligence to analyse retinal images for signs of eye diseases, within minutes. SELENA+ has been deployed nationwide to more than 20 private optometric practices. It has improved the quality and throughput of retinal screening and reduced the complications of diabetes. Precision Health Research, Singapore 14            The healthcare needs and research landscape are constantly evolving and becoming more complex, given our ageing population. With rising prevalence of chronic conditions and late-stage diseases, we will need better treatments and early intervention that produce improved health outcomes. This brings me to the next three business units that are newly established. 15            Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) was set up to implement the national precision medicine strategy. This means using technology to customise healthcare, potentially down to the individual, instead of a one-treatment-for-all model. 16            The key ingredient of precision medicine is data. It is similar to how various websites are able to customise your suggestions to you as an individual customer, because it has a lot of data on the habits and preferences of all its users, such that it can figure out what you most likely want to buy. 17            But in precision medicine, the data needed is not shopping preferences of people, but the data needed is genetic data. In 2019, the Precision Medicine programme established the world’s largest genetic databank for multi-ethnic Asian populations, comprising the data of 10,000 Singaporeans. 18            PRECISE is currently working with different partners to build up lifestyle, environmental and clinical data to gain insights into the factors that contribute to diseases and conditions prevalent in Asia. This is potentially a very rich source of knowledge, to help us prevent diseases through early intervention in lifestyle adjustments. PRECISE has identified five clinical implementation pilots to help determine the best preventive care practices. I look forward to PRECISE contributing to our Healthier SG strategy. Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium 19            Next, in the field of cancer, we have the Singapore Translational Cancer Consortium (STCC). It will further strengthen Singapore’s contribution to international cancer research, and it has been contributing over the past two decades. 20            STCC was established in 2020 as an integrated platform to coordinate cancer research and translation at the national level. In November 2020, STCC coordinated an MOU1 to initiate a multi-institute national precision oncology study involving the National Cancer Centre Singapore, National University Cancer Institute and Roche. 21            I am glad to learn that STCC will take this partnership further, to create a national, anonymised clinico-genomic database that combines clinical insights and real-world evidence to yield better patient outcomes. This will raise cancer research capabilities in Singapore to the next level. Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore 22            Finally, the Advanced Cell Therapy and Research Institute, Singapore (ACTRIS). This is a very fast-moving field in medical science, that may revolutionise healthcare. 23            In recent years, cell therapies have come to the fore as highly effective treatments for several cancers, with the promise of more cures to come. However, these therapies are very costly to develop and manufacture, requiring advanced technologies and specialised staff with skills that are difficult to come by. 24            ACTRIS was set up to develop these capabilities. In partnership with other local institutes such as A*STAR and the universities, it will testbed and validate new manufacturing technologies, and design and develop cost effective production solutions. 25            ACTRIS will also work with NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine to launch a certification course on the Principles and Practice of Cell Therapy, as a first step to build up the niche expertise and know-how to manufacture and administer cell therapy products. 26            In this field, as we develop, we have to be guided by policies as well. There needs to be a whole new set of government policies, and the policies will in turn, have to be guided by ethics. Our ethics committee has a very important part to play. In this context, just several weeks ago, I had a long discussion with former chairman of our bioethics committee, Dr Richard Magnus. Unfortunately, he has passed away. I think he left behind the institution and committee with a lot of wisdom that will have to guide us in this field.  Closing 27            With over two decades of investment in the biomedical sciences, we are now seeing greater innovation and translation and significant growth of our healthcare research ecosystem. CRIS and its business units play a critical role in this.  You are in a unique position to forge synergies, harness complementarities of various initiatives and efforts to grow this industry sector and deliver better outcomes.  28            Just reflecting on Healthier SG, and standing here today launching CRIS, no matter what breakthrough research and discovery you have, you cannot produce practical outcomes without proper ground execution. No matter how good our ground execution is, it cannot make sense, and you cannot deliver outcomes too, without guidance from science, discovery and innovation. The entire MOH ecosystem must work together. And that is our job, collectively. 29            Congratulations to CRIS on the opening of your office. It is in Rochester Park. This is One-North, one degree north of the equator, where life-changing scientific breakthroughs are quietly taking place, in the wonderful place called Singapore. I wish you every success in your journey to help transform healthcare for Singapore.   [1] Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) – Ref: https://www.stcc.sg/post/new-personalised-healthcare-partnership-formed-to-improve-outcomes-for-people-with-cancer-in-sg",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-official-launch-of-the-consortium-for-clinical-research-and-innovation-singapore-(cris),

I want to first acknowledge all the difficulties and hardship that everyone went through during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite us easing measures, cases have been falling. So that is a force of nature. When it decides to go up, no restrictions can suppress it. When it wants to go down, no easing can bring it up. That is what we are dealing with. But that is good news. I am very glad that so far my prediction has been wrong, because I expected that once we ease up, cases will have an uptick. I am very happy to say that I was wrong, but we still have to watch the case numbers next week.2.     But through this process, everyone had to work really hard and adjust. The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) is an example. It has not been easy, you have a pandemic going on and yet you need to save lives every day, and work with the Ministry of Health (MOH) to come up with new protocols. Thankfully, patients were also very patient and cooperative. I think somewhere through the wave, the hospitals were under a lot of pressure, and you took back some patients even though they were COVID-positive and made special arrangements for them to go through dialysis. That has been very valuable to the hospitals, so thank you very much for doing this. 3.     Keppel, not so much on the healthcare front, but the workers’ front. With all your dormitories, it has not been easy. But I think companies like yours managed to have your workers contained in your own dormitories, to ensure safety and still deliver projects without too much delay. Now that we have emerged from a big wave, workers are returning, and I hope that business operations will go back to normal. So thank you very much for being such a resilient company. 4.     Of course, I save my biggest thanks to Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and to all our hospitals. I have never described you as the frontline, because you are not. You are actually the last line of defence. When all else fails, such as vaccines, personal hygiene, safe management measures (SMMs), and our own body resistance, you end up in hospital. Hospitals are the ones who catch all the severe illnesses, with healthcare workers next to the patients to help them get back to normal lives. Every week I check with the CEOs. Things are gradually getting better. So that is extremely delightful to hear. Everyone deserves a big round of applause.5.     On the issue of kidney failure, we need to go upstream. After the COVID-19 pandemic has passed, we need to tackle a far more challenging pandemic – which is longer-term chronic illness, and diabetes is a major one. About 5.7 new patients are diagnosed with kidney failure daily. By the time you have to go for dialysis and build real estate and centres, it is too late. We really need to go upstream.6.      Two nights ago, I had my first barbeque in three years, with some of the volunteers in my constituency. I saw them drinking sweetened soft drinks, and I asked them “Why do you drink this? It has seven teaspoons of sugar in it”. These are young, healthy people, not realising the kind of cases we see in the dialysis centres. I had an uncle with diabetes, in his last days, he was still eating normally. It is very hard to change such habits. Therefore, we have come to the conclusion that putting in all the effort to change one mind will not move the needle at all and relieve our burden. 7.     We need to think of a larger strategy, and in my mind, it must be to mobilise all our General Practitioners (GPs). Make them family physicians trusted by families and in their private settings, when they see a GP, the GP can advise them on their readings, and what they need to do for their family, children and parents. In that circumstance, after you see a GP and the family physician numerous times, there may be enough trust for someone to change their minds. And if you follow through a GP’s care plan, the Government can give you some nudges.8.     So when we talk about Healthier SG, it is in this context. Nothing heroic, nothing about advanced medical technology. It is going back to good old healthcare, relying on the GP and the trust with the families and individual patients. So in a nutshell, we need to mobilise 2,000 GPs plus our primary care providers to be part of preventive care. Then, sometime in the middle of next year, we will go out to all residents 40 years and above, to register and enrol yourself in the national Healthier SG programme. This means you commit to see one GP, maybe once a year, could be telemedicine or physical, and the GP will prescribe you the appropriate vaccination and healthcare screenings, and advise you on what to do. Many of the advice will be based on lifestyle, diet, for example, exercise and cessation of smoking. Some of these will require hospitals to support them, while others require community support, not so much acute care support. That means brisk-walking, exercise and activities that GPs will be referring them to. And if residents follow through, we will need to think of positive nudges that we can give them. Healthcare insurance premiums may come down. We now have a Healthy 365 app, where you clock certain number of steps and get vouchers. We can think about widening this. 9.     In a nutshell, it is a whole movement to move this along. We have not come up with the detailed plan. We intend to do so in the fourth quarter of this year, in the form of a White Paper that I will bring up to Parliament for a detailed discussion. In the meantime, we are consulting many people. Just last week, we had a virtual townhall with 1,000 GPs. They provided very good guidelines on the things to watch out for, in order for this to work out in the GP sector. This is a major piece of work. After COVID, this is the most important national healthcare agenda for us.10.     Back to this centre, thank you everyone for putting in the effort to set up this integrated centre. In the future, we should think of how to integrate dialysis centres with other private care settings. It will make a lot more sense. So to be located in a community hospital, I hope it is a start. I thank Keppel Care Foundation for all your help, donation and support. Do continue to always support healthcare.11.     Last but not least, have a good weekend. Stay safe, stay healthy.

I am happy to join you today for the official opening of the Clinic for Advanced Rehabilitation Therapeutics (CART) by Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH). Today we are also commemorating CART’s 10th anniversary. I am glad to see that from version 1.0, we are now at version 2.0, and I hope with many more versions to come.2. TTSH has been a pioneer in the development of rehabilitation medicine in Singapore. Over the years, the hospital has played a key role in raising the quality of life and restoring the functional ability of patients suffering from strokes, spinal cord conditions, traumatic brain and limb injuries, as well as amputations.3. With the advancement of medical technology and digitalisation, TTSH established CART 10 years ago to further its work in this area. The first CART was a consolidation of various outpatient rehab services, including TTSH’s offsite outpatient rehab clinic and also, the gym. The current CART is now a few times larger than the original, and taking into account the advancements in technology in this area, its range of services has also expanded to rehabilitate more types of patients. With this, not only can more patients can be seen, there will also be quicker access to the outpatient rehab services. I want to highlight three key features that I think make CART 2.0 vastly improved from 1.0.4. The first is the use of technology. CART combines conventional medical and rehab approaches with specialised rehab technologies such as robotics and virtual reality. The technologies improve patients’ diagnosis and monitoring, and enable patients to gradually gain control of their movement and strengths through home therapy and without having to visit a clinic. 10 years ago, we did not have such advanced technology yet, which can be put to very good use to help people recover.5. One example is the H-MAN, a portable arm rehabilitation robot that can be installed at home. It helps patients rebuild their hand and arm strength while playing games using a joystick. Given the interactive and gamification nature of these technologies, patients who used to find the exercises repetitive and monotonous, will now become more engaged and interested.6. CART will continue to work closely with industry and the academia partners on rehab innovations. I hope to see more of such projects, including projects that are near-market commercialisation that can undergo trials in CART before being contextualised to our local setting, and then adopted, and scaled-up, and thereafter involve patients.7. The second feature is manpower and talent. Technology needs to go hand in hand with the hard work of the well-trained and committed rehab care professionals. They are a multi-disciplinary team including Allied Health Professionals, nurses and doctors who are trained in rehab medicine.8. Our healthcare manpower needs are growing across the entire healthcare ecosystem, and that includes the rehab services. We will continue to work with our Institutes of Higher Learning and training partners to provide a range of training and development opportunities, not only for fresh school leavers but also mid-career individuals keen to enter into and contribute to the sector. In an area like rehab services, there are a lot of opportunities for mid-career switches who can help patients in need of recovering their bodily functions and strengths.9. The third feature is community partnership. With a rapidly ageing population and higher prevalence of chronic diseases, demand for rehab services will grow. Rehab must be made accessible to a wider range of patients, especially the elderly who can become frail after acute illnesses. Through community partnership, we can shift the care models to make rehab more accessible to patients. It is critically important that this is not just available in hospitals. It needs to be available in the community. As the population gets older, our seniors need to know that downstairs, in the precinct, near the hawker centre, near the MRT station, is where they can go for rehab services. So we need to rethink the way we deploy resources at present on the ground. That relates back to the use of technology in the community, so that it is not such a huge hurdle that people feel technology is only found in hospitals, or only found in universities. Rehab manpower and expertise must be able to be found everywhere, so that even the laymen could be trained to help out with our patients.10. To facilitate the flow of patients through their care continuum, CART is partnering Stroke Support Station (S3) – it is a community organisation - to direct or refer discharged stroke patients for continued active rehab or wellness activities. Through S3, patients with stable conditions who do not require surgery or complex interventions can get access to rehab services in the community or at their homes. Patients will have access to advanced assistive technologies, and robotic-aided rehab facilities. CART and S3 will also be exploring tele-collaboration and tele-consultation services. I think that there is great promise for this. Post-COVID, people now know telemedicine can work. Before that, it is all quite scary, quite alien. But after COVID-19, where we all have to recover from home, and then doctors can give us the attention via Zoom, telemedicine – it has shown that medicine can be delivered to our homes as well. So there are lots of promises and opportunities we can work on.11. I thank TTSH‘s dedication and commitment and also, all your partners, for all your help for all these years to take care of our patients and integrate them back into the community. I think, just now, Dr Loh Yong Joo gave a tagline that I thought it is very useful – that at CART, patients are always at the heart. Congratulations on the opening of CART.

Most symptoms will resolve within a few days, and not all symptoms require a review by a doctor. Serious side effects that may warrant medical attention include allergic reactions or heart and chest symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heart beats. Appeals for waivers of Emergency Department (ED) and Specialist Outpatient Clinic bills incurred post-vaccination may be extended on a goodwill basis, if the visit has been assessed to be appropriate and potentially vaccination-related by the attending clinician. The National University Hospital has reached out to Ms Qiu to assist her with the waiver of her son’s bills. For bills that are not waived, Singaporeans and Permanent Residents may tap on the regular healthcare financing framework, such as Government subsidies, MediShield Life/ Integrated Shield Plans and MediSave where applicable, to help pay for their bills. Those who face financial difficulties may approach medical social workers at the respective public healthcare institutions for further financial assistance. To ensure that we can prioritise ED resources for those with life-threatening and emergency medical conditions, individuals who experience mild symptoms following their vaccination or booster doses are urged to first seek help through their regular primary care provider, rather than walk into the EDs. Unnecessary visits to the EDs add to the load on hospitals, which have to help persons with serious illnesses.  Teh Shi-Hua (Ms)Director (Subsidy and Subvention), Healthcare Finance GroupMinistry of Health",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/medical-bills-can-be-paid-through-healthcare-financing-frameworks,

And when the new data and findings become available and we discover that an earlier decision was inappropriate, we were prepared to change our positions and our policies, and explain the reasons to the public.  3.             However, COVID-19 also poses difficult dilemmas, which involve decisions that go beyond science, but require balancing health, economic and social considerations. This is a very difficult juggling act which all governments have to go through. And that is why there is a saying, “lives versus livelihoods”, which encapsulates the dilemmas that we all face. 4.             For many countries, that decision – “lives versus livelihoods” – was unfortunately taken out of their hands because these countries undertook responses that were targeted against something like Influenza. But COVID-19 is not Influenza; it is far more deadly.  As a result, the virus swept through their countries. Today, with immunity from both infection and vaccination, many of these countries have acquired strong herd protection and they could now live life normally. Happy outcome, but only after paying the huge price in human casualties.   5.             Fortunately, having gone through SARS in 2003, we have developed a set of measures that could contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus when it arrived in Singapore in 2019, through isolation, contact tracing, border controls and curbing social activities.  China’s effort to quickly map the genome of the virus and make it available to the world proved to be decisive and crucial for the rest of us, as it enabled the rapid development of test kits, which laid the foundation for our pandemic response. 6.             As a result, we could keep our society relatively safe, until vaccines became available and we administered them to the large majority of our population. We made a special effort to reach out to seniors, who are the most vulnerable. We implemented vaccination-differentiated measures for public spaces and travel, to reduce the risk of exposure for those who are not fully vaccinated, and to nudge people to get vaccinated.  7.             When a large majority of our population has been vaccinated, we were then confident enough to shift our strategy from “zero-COVID” to “Living with COVID-19”. It was not easy but progressively, we re-opened our economy, occasionally stepping on the brakes to protect our healthcare system and our people. 8.             In this process, the biggest change is not policy and health measures, but our societal and population mindset.  From thinking that this is a deadly virus which we need to avoid at all cost, to being able to live with it as one of the many risks in lives, provided that we are well-vaccinated.  It also involves a change in focus from overall infection numbers to that of severe cases leading to the intensive care unit or death.  So the key area of focus is to ensure sufficient healthcare capacity to manage the severe cases.   9.             Today, having gone through a major Omicron wave, our case numbers are relatively low, hospital operations are stable, borders are open, social and economic activities are almost back to normal.  Fortunately our accumulated incidence of fatalities is one of the lowest in the world.  10.          It was a difficult and arduous journey, and we have to feel our way forward like crossing a river one stone at a time (摸着石头过河).  Ours is an approach that best suits our needs and circumstances as a globally connected city state which needs to tap into the world in order to survive.  Other countries will have to tailor their pandemic responses based on their own unique circumstances, priorities, and societal cultures.  But ultimately, it is for each country to make the best choice for its people based on the available information as well as a combination of natural and social sciences. 11.          Thank you.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-singapore-at-the-2022-boao-forum-for-asia-(bfa)-annual-conference-panel-session-on-science-based-approach-in-fighting-against-the-pandemic,

The booster dose may be received from about 28 days after the infection, and should not be delayed beyond nine months after completing their primary vaccine course.2.      There has been recent evidence that immune protection in recovered persons who are vaccinated can vary between individuals and wanes with time. Booster vaccination is safe in recovered persons and helps maintain a high level of protection against severe disease. Hence, persons aged 12 years and above, who had previously completed their primary vaccination series and recovered from a COVID-19 infection, are now recommended to receive a COVID-19 booster.3.      With this new recommendation, a booster dose is now being recommended for all persons aged 12 years and above, regardless of whether they had a previous COVID-19 infection.Second Booster Can Be Offered to Persons Aged 60-79 Years4.      To provide additional protection against severe COVID-19, a second COVID-19 booster has been recommended for the following groups of persons, who are most at-risk for severe disease and the waning of vaccine effectiveness:a.       All persons aged 80 years and above;b.       Persons living in aged care facilities, such as nursing homes; andc.        Medically vulnerable persons who are at increased risk of severe disease due to significant medical risk factors1.5.      A proportion of our seniors aged 60 to 79 years may have underlying medical conditions, and may themselves be concerned about their increased risk of severe disease. Considering this, a second booster can also be offered to persons aged 60 to 79 years who wish to be vaccinated.6.      EC19V encourages all eligible persons recommended to receive booster vaccination(s) to do so with an mRNA vaccine (i.e., Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna/Spikevax vaccines) because of better vaccine effectiveness. EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION22 APRIL 2022[1] Vulnerable persons are individuals who are at increased risk of severe disease due to significant medical risk factors.

I am pleased to join you in celebrating the official opening of Brahm Centre's new campus at Newton.    Importance of Mental Health and Well-being   2.     Mental health is an integral component of overall health and well-being. Awareness of its importance has grown over the past two years due to the additional stressors brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Local studies have described the significant impact of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of different segments of the Singapore population.  i) For instance, an in-depth study by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on Singaporeans’ mental well-being during the pandemic found that about 13% of the respondents reported experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety in the period from May 2020 to June 2021. ii) Among the seniors, the Singapore Life Panel study conducted by the Singapore Management University Centre for Research on Successful Ageing (ROSA) reported a stark increase in feelings of isolation among older Singaporeans as the Circuit Breaker began in April 2020, with larger increases observed for those living alone.iii) Lastly, among the youths, regular polls conducted by the National Youth Council (NYC) between April and December 2020 on youths’ challenges and sentiments during COVID-19 found mental well-being to be a challenge for over half the youth population (52%) surveyed.3.     Even as we gradually resume normal activities, many of us may continue to feel anxious or worried. In this regard, a supportive community is crucial in normalising conversations on mental health and encouraging those with mental health needs to reach out for help. Brahm Centre and Community Mental Health Efforts  4.     Brahm Centre is an important partner in providing mental health support services. Since its inception in 2012, it has offered programmes, such as mindfulness talks and mental health resources, to support the needs of the community. Brahm Centre has also been a community partner with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) since 2016 to provide educational and support services for individuals with mental health needs and their caregivers.  5.     Over the years, Brahm Centre has expanded from one centre with just three staff, to four centres with a team of over 52 staff. It has also expanded its initial focus in promoting happier and healthier living to seniors to include adults and youths as well. With its new campus in Newton, Brahm Centre will offer specialised mental health services to both adults and youths.  6.     Locally, the prevalence of mental health conditions is the highest amongst youth aged 18 to 34 years, with about 1 in 5 experiencing a mental health condition in their lifetime. I am heartened that social service agencies such as Brahm Centre have stepped up to offer services to support our youths in their life journey, especially during this critical period.  For instance, Brahm Centre works with schools to deliver talks and workshops for students on mental health and mindfulness to manage stress and build resilience. It also runs a helpline and counselling service to provide youths with basic emotional support, which has benefited more than 600 youths to date. Brahm Centre also offers the Mindful Academic Coaching programme, a free peer-led one-to-one academic coaching service for secondary school students, where students or recent graduates of tertiary institutions serve as coaches to guide the secondary school students in their academic, social-emotional and communication skills. Late last year, Brahm Centre launched the Lighthouse Program, a mindfulness-based mental health literacy programme targeted at students, parents and teachers to gain a deeper understanding of how our minds work to achieve effective learning and emotional regulation. Since January 2022, this programme has reached out to about 1,900 students, 350 teachers and 50 parents. 7.     I thank Brahm Centre for their many years of hard work and dedication, and look forward to learning about the new initiatives offered in the Newton campus in time to come. Upcoming Public Consultation on Mental Health  8.     In recognition of the importance of mental health and the need for coordinated action across sectors, the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being was set up last year to oversee and coordinate cross-cutting national mental health issues. The Taskforce has been reviewing the population’s mental health needs and has identified four focus areas. These include the need to strengthen services and family support for parents and youths; improve access to mental health care by integrating health and social services; provide employment support for persons with mental health conditions; and improve mental health literacy to create a more inclusive society. 9.     As part of its review, the Taskforce recognises the importance of hearing the thoughts of our key stakeholders and the general public. The Taskforce plans to hold a public consultation in the coming months to seek the views of mental health stakeholders and members of the public on the preliminary recommendations. We look forward to engaging our stakeholders and fellow citizens to co-create solutions to improve the mental health ecosystem in Singapore. Closing 10.     In closing, I would like to congratulate Brahm Centre on the launch of the new centre, and express my appreciation for your extraordinary contribution to promoting happier and healthier living. Let us continue to work together to foster greater mental well-being and resilience in our society.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-dr-janil-puthucheary-senior-minister-of-state-ministry-of-health-for-the-opening-of-brahm-centre@newton-on-23-april-2022,

These include allowing in-person visits for all individuals (i.e. patients, residents and visitors) regardless of vaccination status.2.     MOH had earlier announced the resumption of in-person visits to hospitals and Homes from 4 April 2022 for fully-vaccinated individuals and those who are medically ineligible for COVID-19 vaccination. With the further easing of community measures from 26 April 2022, there will also be adjustments to the safe management measures (SMMs) for in-person visits to hospitals and Homes. 3.     As hospitals and Homes are settings with vulnerable individuals and there is a need to protect them from infection, hospitals and Homes may continue to put in place certain SMMs such as pre-registration of visitors for patients in Hospitals, and to allow only two visitors at the bedside each time to avoid crowding in the wards/Homes. 4.     As part of social responsibility, all visitors are encouraged to administer a COVID-19 self-test prior to visiting their loved ones at the hospital or Home. Visitors should not visit their loved ones if they are feeling unwell. All visitors entering the hospital wards or Homes must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabric. Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards or residential areas of the Homes, or use the toilets designated for patients/residents in the wards/Homes. They should also avoid sitting on patients’/residents’ beds. They should also abide by the hospital’s visiting hours and do not disturb other patients from their rest.5.     Visits to Homes will be capped at one hour to allow all families the opportunity to visit their loved ones. Visitors should continue to schedule the visits with the Home ahead of time. We also seek the understanding of visitors that visits may have to be suspended if a Home is managing active COVID-19 cases. Next-of-kin of residents may approach the Home for further details.    6.     Our hospitals are still seeing a higher than usual non-COVID workload. We seek the public’s continued cooperation to comply with the measures and remain socially responsible to keep patients/residents safe even as we take strides towards normalcy.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/further-easing-of-measures-for-in-person-visits-to-hospitals-and-residential-care-homes,

This will enable us to start offering the Nuvaxovid vaccine at our first Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre (JTVC) at the former Bishan Park Secondary School, as well as 20 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) at the end of this month.2.   Slated for operations in end-May 2022, the JTVCs will be a new class of facilities which will offer both COVID-19 testing and vaccination services in the same premise. The JTVCs will allow us to consolidate our resources, while ensuring testing and vaccination services remain accessible to the public. We are also working to onboard selected PHPCs to offer the Nuvaxovid vaccine. Further details will be announced in the coming weeks. 3.   On 14 February 2022, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce accepted the recommendation of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) to include the Nuvaxovid vaccine in the National Vaccination Programme for use in individuals aged 18 years and above, for both COVID-19 primary series and booster vaccination.4.   Having considered the data on its safety, efficacy and tolerability, the EC19V recommends the Nuvaxovid vaccine as an acceptable alternative to the mRNA vaccines in individuals aged 18 years and above, although the mRNA vaccines still remain the preferred vaccines due to their higher efficacy and the stronger immune response generated.5.   Boosters and vaccinations remain a critical part of our COVID-19 strategy in ensuring our population is well protected against infection and severe illness. We urge all who are eligible for vaccinations and booster doses to receive them as soon as possible.MINISTRY OF HEALTH4 MAY 2022",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/first-shipment-of-nuvaxovid-covid-19-vaccine-has-arrived-in-singapore_4May2022,

This is our 22nd polyclinic and is one of our three newest polyclinics that opened in the past year. With this latest polyclinic, we are another step closer to our target of having 32 polyclinics by 2030. 2.     Residents can access a range of services at Kallang Polyclinic. They can seek care for acute conditions and chronic diseases, and receive services such as physiotherapy, scans and blood tests, and get the medications they need. New mothers can also go for regular check-ups and young children can receive their necessary vaccinations. 3.     We have been co-locating healthcare facilities in recent years, to make it more convenient for residents to access a large range of healthcare services. This also opens up opportunities for synergies and collaboration. For Kallang Polyclinic, we made a conscious decision to co-locate the polyclinic with KWSH. 4.     It means day care clients and their caregivers at the KWSH Senior Care Centre can seek care at the polyclinic conveniently, without having to travel to different locations. Polyclinic patients with high care needs who eventually require nursing home care, can experience a more seamless transition to KWSH if placed there. 5.     I thank KWSH for being a reliable and valuable partner of MOH all these years. Strengthening preventive care 6.     Strengthening healthcare capacity is an important part of meeting our healthcare needs in the medium to long term. But with an ageing population and deteriorating health, it is not sustainable to keep expanding healthcare capacity to treat and manage illness. We must work on areas of improvement that maybe less pressing, but more important – which is to make ourselves healthier. That is why we announced the Healthier SG strategy earlier this year. 7.     With a new polyclinic, comes new opportunities and ground capabilities and presence, to try out new ways to help residents stay healthy. 8.     Kallang Polyclinic has taken steps to empower patients to take ownership of their health. I heard that Kallang Polyclinic has several self-service blood pressure machines, where patients will be able to check their own blood pressure. 9.     There is an Edible Garden which grows fresh herbs. Dieticians will use the Garden to share with patients healthier and natural flavouring options. I wonder if patients can fulfil their health and diet prescriptions from the garden. 10.     Kallang Polyclinic is the first NHG polyclinic to develop a fully automated vaccine management system. Bearing in mind that patient safety is of utmost importance, nurses can use this machine to cross-check the selected vaccine against an in-built recognition system to ensure that the correct vaccine is picked for the correct patient. The machine can also monitor and report inventory in real time, and keep track of the expiry date of vaccines. 11.     The Polyclinic will also be an active adopter of NHGP’s teamlet model. Under this model, patients with chronic conditions are assigned to a regular, multi-disciplinary care team. By having the same care team attend to the same patient, we build trust between the patient and the care team. There is greater continuity of care, patients are more likely to follow up to do their part, resulting in better outcomes, such as having better control of diabetes, fewer referrals to specialists and hospital admissions. Connecting the Dots 12.     My hope for Kallang Polyclinic is that it can play a big role in enhancing the health of the residents around here, through Healthier SG. When we treat severe illness, all the action happens in a hospital. When we build health, all the action happens in the community, across different settings, embedded in the lives and lifestyles of people. 13.     So the key success factor to achieve better health, is to be able to connect the dots between community partners and various agencies to support residents and patients. Then, all stakeholders work seamlessly across settings in the community, and appropriate care follows the patient. 14.     How do we connect the dots? I think there are several aspects. 15.     First is making sure relevant data and information flow, from hospitals to polyclinics to clinics to community health posts. With shared information, seamless care becomes possible. Hence the National Electronic Health Record system is critical. 16.     Second is to ensure service providers are operating from a similar playbook. A resident must know that whichever provider they choose to go to, they can receive fairly similar support and help. 17.     A good starting point is to develop detailed care protocols for common preventable and chronic conditions. It is not different from during the COVID-19 pandemic, when all doctors share and understand the care protocols for COVID-19 patients. Those common protocols enable hospitals, polyclinics and family physicians to work seamlessly as a wider care team. 18.     Third, is to harness best practices and support from each other to continually raise care standards. Within the Primary Care Networks, General Practitioners (GPs) are already learning from one another and sharing resources to offer team-based care. 19.     Fourth, is to bring in non-healthcare, community partners. This is so that we can fulfil ‘social prescriptions’. Because to maintain health, you need good daily habits, and not just going to the doctor diligently. 20.     Kallang Polyclinic’s RELATE programme is one example of social prescription. RELATE stands for RELationship-based heAlth and social inTEgration, where patients receive additional support and services to address social issues that can affect their health. 21.     So a senior may have chronic conditions like poorly controlled diabetes and at the same time is assessed to be at risk of social isolation. His family physician will provide medical care and can refer him to a befrienders programme or join a brisk-walking interest group. 22.     The challenge of such programmes is to ensure that the patient will follow up, and the doctor can review their progress months later. To ensure this, Kallang Polyclinic has established platforms where various agencies and partners will come together to share notes and discuss the common care plans of patients with complex social and health issues, to ensure that care is integrated, holistic and seamless. We foresee more of such collaborations under Healthier SG. 23.     Finally, we must all share the same mission. That through Healthier SG, we shift the emphasis from sickness care to healthcare. It requires us to change our existing mindset, and the way to care for a patient. If we do it right, within ten years, we can collectively enhance the quality of lives of many people and their families. Closing 24.     In closing, I would like to congratulate NHGP on the official opening of Kallang Polyclinic. I am confident you will be a valuable asset in this community, a place to bring health, relief, comfort, friendship and happiness to the residents living around here.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-official-opening-of-kallang-polyclinic-on-7-may-2022-12.00pm,

The two VCs will administer the last paediatric Dose 1 and last paediatric Dose 2 on 9 June 2022 and 30 June 2022 respectively. To ensure COVID-19 vaccination remains accessible to this age group, three polyclinics and selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) will come onboard to continue providing paediatric vaccine doses. 2.         The three polyclinics, Pioneer Polyclinic, Punggol Polyclinic and Woodlands Polyclinic, will commence provision on 18 May 2022, while the selected PHPCs will progressively commence provision from 25 May 2022. The list of polyclinics and PHPCs offering paediatric vaccines can be found at vaccine.gov.sg/locations 3.         As of 10 May 2022, about 81% of children aged 5 to 11 have either booked an appointment for or received their first dose, while about 69% have received their second dose. Among the students in our primary schools, more than 86% have received at least their first dose, while about 77% have received both doses. In addition, about 35,600 children born in 2016 and 2017 have registered on Ministry of Health (MOH)’s National Appointment System. About 32,700 have received at least their first dose, while about 26,700 have received their second dose. 4.         Parents/guardians who wish to vaccinate their child/ward at the selected polyclinics and PHPCs will have to first register their child/ward at child.vaccine.gov.sg. An SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the registered mobile number of the parent/guardian within three to five working days to book a vaccination appointment. To better manage overall patient load and reduce waiting time, the polyclinics and PHPCs offering paediatric vaccination will only accept appointments made via the National Appointment System for now. 5.         All children aged 5 to 11 must be accompanied by a parent/guardian on the day of the vaccination. Parents/guardians should bring along the child’s Student Identification, or other forms of identification (e.g. Birth Certificate/Passport/SingPass) for verification. Parents/guardians will also be required to bring a signed hard or soft copy of the parental consent form, which can be downloaded at https://go.gov.sg/parcf. 6.         Vaccinations remain a critical part of our strategy in ensuring our children are well protected against infection and severe illness should they be infected with COVID-19.

We are now starting on the path to recovery – reopening our borders to travel, gradually resuming normal activities. 4.             Our biggest enemy today is not the COVID-19 virus, but complacency, a sense that now that life is back to normal, we can let our guard now.  This will be a huge mistake. 5.             In the coming few months, we are all likely to see new waves in our countries, either a resurgence of Omicron wave as our societal immunity wanes, or a new variant that drive re-infections.  A more dangerous threat is a new virus, which is bound to come as human activities continue to encroach into nature, and humans and animals continue to come into close contact. 6.             When that happens, we must be more ready than when we encountered the COVID-19 virus. So while we all enjoy the respite now, let’s also embark on the critical and important tasks ahead.  There are a few areas if I may suggest that we can focus on the health front: a.    First, testing and surveillance. We have achieved a breakthrough in the establishment of ACPHEED.  This forms the nucleus of a regular monitoring and good surveillance capabilities and response system in our region.  This will give us early warning of new COVID-19 variants of concern (VOC) and other emerging infectious diseases. b.    Second, the availability of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics.  In particular, we must not let up our current efforts to vaccinate and boost our populations. Their immunity will wane over time, and there is a real risk that current vaccines will be less effective against the next variant of concern. Internally, ASEAN can collaborate better to ensure that vaccine supplies are available for those who need them, such as doing more to facilitate vaccine donations and swaps among us.  These are issues we will have to raise with our dialogue partners. c.     Third, ensuring the resilience of travel lanes and supply chains.  The pandemic has contributed to an unprecedented rise in shipping costs, which has not subsided. It has also disrupted travel completely.  At the Retreat this morning, we discussed the establishment of an ASEAN mutual recognition system for vaccine certificates.  From there we can forge similar systems with other regions, such as US, China, India and the EU.

The meeting also welcomed the operationalisation of the ASEAN Centre for Public Health Emergencies and Emerging Diseases (ACPHEED), which will enhance ASEAN’s capacity in prevention, detection and response to public health emergencies. 3.             With ASEAN recovering from the pandemic and re-opening our borders to the world, it is important to establish seamless travel across the region, such as the use of digital technology to mutually recognise vaccination certificates across countries. The ASEAN Health Ministers and senior officials agreed to work towards an ASEAN Universal Verification Mechanism to facilitate smooth international travel, while protecting the data privacy and security of each ASEAN member state. 4.             At the meetings, Minister for Health Mr Ong Ye Kung highlighted that ASEAN member states have managed to weather the COVID-19 pandemic because of their close cooperation. However, countries must remain vigilant and guard against complacency as lives return to normal across the region. In the coming few months, ASEAN member states are likely to see new waves as societal immunity wanes, or a new variant that drives re-infections. 5.             To prepare for the new waves and a potential new virus, in his intervention delivered at the 15th ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting, Minister Ong highlighted three main areas of focus: a)    Testing and surveillance: The establishment of ACPHEED forms the nucleus of a regular monitoring and good surveillance capabilities and response system in the ASEAN region.  This will provide early warning of new COVID-19 variants of concern (VOC) and other emerging infectious diseases. b)    Availability of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics: We must continue our current efforts to vaccinate and boost our populations as immunity will wane over time and current vaccines will be less effective against the next VOC. Internally, ASEAN can collaborate better to ensure that vaccine supplies are available for those who need them, such as doing more to facilitate vaccine donations and swaps among countries.  c)    Ensuring resilience of travel lanes and supply chains: As societies in ASEAN and our partner countries achieve stronger society resilience to COVID-19 virus, we should strive to ensure that even if new infection waves arrive, supply chains are not disrupted and immigration borders remain open. In this regard, the ASEAN mutual recognition system for vaccine certificates will be a critical tool. From there we can forge similar systems with other regions, such as the US, China, India and the EU. 6.             During the trip, Minister Ong also held bilateral meetings with H.E. Budi G. Sadikin, Minister of Health, Republic of Indonesia and Chair of the 15th ASEAN Health Ministers Meeting; H.E. Anutin Charnvirakul, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Public Health, Thailand; and H.E. Dato Seri Setia Dr Haji Mohammad Isham bin Haji Jaafar, Minister of Health, Brunei Darussalam. The parties shared their experience in handling the COVID-19 pandemic and discussed future collaborations towards strengthening health systems for public health emergencies. 7.             Singapore looks forward to continuing to work closely with ASEAN member states and dialogue partners to enhance regional public health preparedness and response, and strengthen health cooperation.  MINISTRY OF HEALTH15 MAY 2022",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/regional-health-cooperation-reaffirmed-at-15th-asean-health-ministers-meeting-and-related-meetings,T

At the Assembly, Singapore will be tabling its resolution Strengthening Health Emergency Preparedness and Response in Cities and Urban Settings.    2.          Singapore urges Member States to invest in urban health emergency preparedness, and to take a whole-of-government and multi-sectoral approach in planning and response. As a city-state deeply aware of the challenges that infectious threats bring to urban settings, Singapore has been working with the World Health Organization (WHO) on the area of preparedness in cities and urban settings even before COVID-19. The adoption of Singapore’s resolution, which is its first at the World Health Assembly, will signal Member States’ support for the implementation of the WHO Framework for Strengthening Health Emergency Preparedness in Cities and Urban Settings, which was launched in January 2022 by Singapore and the WHO. 3.          The World Health Assembly is WHO’s highest decision-making body. Held annually, it sets out WHO’s policy and approves its budget. Attendees include Health Ministers from WHO Member States, WHO Director-General, Regional-Directors of the six WHO Regions, and senior officials from Member States and WHO. The theme for this year’s World Health Assembly is ‘Health for Peace, Peace for Health’. 4.          This year, the World Health Assembly will discuss key public health issues including: a.          Paradigm shift towards preventive care and health promotion;b.          Reorientation of health systems towards primary health care as the foundation of universal health coverage; andc.          Health emergency preparedness, response and resilience, including in cities and urban settings.5.          Mr Ong will also meet with WHO Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and other counterparts during the visit.

But even putting age aside, people are getting less healthy. Our lifestyles are becoming more sedentary, we are spending more time on electronic devices, we are not eating well, we are not sleeping well. And in a modern society, modern lifestyle can also take its toll on mental health. 3.                 The wave of chronic diseases from unhealthy lifestyles is in the long term potentially more challenging than COVID-19 infection waves in the short term. 4.                 The necessary and natural response of health ministries around the world is to keep on investing and expanding healthcare capacity to treat more and more sick people. But that alone is not enough if we want to treat the problem at its roots. We cannot accept that more people getting sick is a given. As governments, we need to make people healthier and prevent them from becoming chronically ill in the first place. 5.                 Indeed, we need to focus on healthcare, not sickness care. We need to put more weight on building health, in families and communities, and not limit ourselves only to treating sickness in hospitals and operating theatres. 6.                 If we are determined to do this, then the part of healthcare that needs the most strengthening is primary care. 7.                 That is why we believe that the future of healthcare lies in primary care. We will make preventive care our top healthcare priority for the next decade. 8.                 That is why family doctors must become a central figure, because they make up our primary care system. We need public policies to better support family doctors to help the population stay healthy. 9.                 We need to build strong links and referral protocols between family doctors and hospitals, so the latter can better support them, especially for the serious and complex cases. 10.             We need family doctors to offer not drug prescriptions, but also social prescriptions like better diet, regular exercise to inculcate good health habits. We will link them up with community organisers who can deliver such healthy regimes. 11.             We need to encourage people, including healthy ones, to commit to see one family doctor regularly and over the long term. We need IT systems that share medical records of patients seamlessly across different healthcare settings. 12.             We live in an era of fascinating medical technology advancement. We need to embrace them. But the most urgent healthcare policies have got to do with simpler policies that support the humble and essential family doctor. 13.             And this is part of the universality of healthcare. Thank you.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/minister-of-health-mr-ong-ye-kung-s-intervention-for-75th-world-health-assembly-23-may-2022,

Whether it was testing, surveillance, quarantine, contact tracing, availability of hospital beds, ventilators, we were not prepared. Supply chains disrupted, schools closed, borders closed.  2.     Then came Omicron wave, and I think we were better prepared. All the systems, facilities, processes were better in place. And thankfully, Omicron was a less severe variant compared to Delta.  3.       A next infection wave will inevitably come, it may either be BA.4 and BA.5, or some other new variant totally – hopefully not as severe. The question is, will we be well prepared, when it comes, likely in the winter of this year.  4.        A lot of work has gone in, a lot of initiatives have been rolled out, and Singapore is thankful for all these initiatives. So I don’t want to go into that, I’d rather just touch on one issue, which is an issue of mindset and focus.  5.        I hope that WHO and the world, we will focus on the bottom-line, which is how many people will die, and fall severely ill, instead of the top-line, which is how many people get infected.  6.        The reason why I say that is because the science is pointing us in that direction, because the virus will continue to mutate quite quickly. Variant-specific vaccines will take months, I think six months, to develop, and still, many more months to produce, so we cannot keep up with the mutations.  7.        So the best thing to do is to protect ourselves against severe illness. Furthermore, the expectations of our population is to continue to live life normally, rather than to lock down, and prevent infection. But to focus on the bottom-line is not our natural tendency. It is much easier to measure infection because a positive result is a positive result, while severe illness is subjective. So a conscious effort has to be taken for us to focus on the right metric. Which is the bottom-line – how many people die, how many people fall severely ill. And only then, will we then realise that the foundation of our response is not lock-downs, but vaccinations, and we will put our minds to it to make sure that we have as many of our population in the world vaccinated as possible.  8.        We need to take these steps now to strengthen health emergency preparedness and response, especially in cities and urban settings, as cities are where viruses spread the fastest, and they are also our first line of readiness and response.  9.        On behalf of Member States which co-sponsored the resolution on strengthening emergency preparedness in cities and urban settings, we thank Member States for their support and look forward to the adoption of this resolution.   Thank you.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/intervention-by-minister-for-health-mr-ong-ye-kung-on-strengthening-who-preparedness-for-and-response-to-health-emergencies,

Before I start delivering my speech, I would like to thank the European community for standing by Singapore for this difficult two and a half years. Health Starts From Our Daily Lives 2.     It is a timely publication, just after the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced a major healthcare reform effort, that we call Healthier SG. This is a very complex undertaking. It involves many moving parts, many partners – private and public – and many stakeholders. 3.     But the idea of Healthier SG is actually a fairly simple one, i.e. if we can focus on keeping people healthy, through preventive care, we can avoid a lot of suffering, financial burden, and emotional burden of patients, their families and society as a whole later on. Yet it is difficult to muster the energy and resources to do preventive care, because we always focus on what is urgent, and we do not focus on what is less urgent but more important. And preventive care is as urgent but more important. But, post COVID-19, we want to give this our best shot. 4.     COVID-19 is too big a crisis to be wasted. During the pandemic, as countries switched to emergency response mode, healthcare practices and policies got turned on their heads. In the past before COVID-19, there were always concerns about adequacy of IT systems; there was always difficulty in disseminating rules and ensuring adherence; there was always worry about potential abuse by a minority, but all these bent to the needs for a crisis response during COVID-19. 5.     Now, as the dust settles and we earned a well-deserving respite, we find ourselves inheriting a new healthcare edifice that is perhaps fitter for peace time. We have IT systems that now link up all healthcare providers. We have individuals who have downloaded apps that help them stay healthy. 6.     We now have a whole national set up that can conduct diagnostics and deliver vaccinations to the masses. We have an established practice of telemedicine for those recovering from COVID-19 at home. I would say one of the biggest advantages of COVID-19 is that people now understand vaccines, what they do, and what the risks and benefits are. 7.     Our hospitals have a stronger system to right-site patients to community and home care. Most importantly, people are prepared to heed public healthcare messages. 8.     The accomplishments during COVID-19 provide the impetus for us to launch Healthier SG now. Having gone through COVID-19 infection waves, we have the systems, policies and practices to translate the vision into reality, and usher in a new era of healthcare. 9.     There are major differences between acute and preventive care. Acute care is often episodic can be painful, difficult, costly and distressing for patients and their loved ones. And it often happens in hospitals, in operating theatres, surrounded by doctors and nurses. 10.     Preventive care on the other hand is not episodic. It has to be done as a sustained effort, and if it is done early enough, it is easy, affordable, enjoyable, surrounded by friends and families. 11.     Because of these differences, patients have become consumers, and vice versa when it comes to preventive care. I therefore believe preventive care opens up far more opportunities for innovation and participation by enterprises and industries, and we have a great opportunity to build a strong public-private-people partnership for health through Healthier SG and preventive care. 12.     This is where an organisation like EuroCham comes in, and my pitch to you today. Let me highlight three areas that companies can participate in. Food 13.     First, food. 14.     We are what we eat. Good food choices nourish our health, while bad choices literally poison us over the long term. Unfortunately, there is a perception that healthy food is expensive – associated with exotic superfoods and special prescription diets – or unenjoyable, because we must somehow be deprived in order to be healthy. 15.     All these are wrong. The best food intervention for the majority of us, is to simply cut down salt, sugar and oil, and by doing so, you can avoid severe chronic illnesses like high blood pressure, heart diseases and diabetes. 16.     Take for example, salt intake. Based on the National Nutrition Survey 2018/19, Singaporeans consumed an average of 3.6g of sodium per day, which is higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended amount of less than 2g per day for adults. Sugar is even more harmful than salt. 17.     So in my home, we learnt to cook with less salt and soya sauce. It is not a deprivation, because we learnt to appreciate the natural flavours of ingredients and improve our cooking skills. As a personal habit, I drink beverages such as coffee and tea, including the occasional bubble tea, without sugar. These changes in personal eating habits do not cost more. But they make a big difference for our health later on. 18.     Businesses can help bring about such personal habitual adjustments. For instance, Knorr, a brand under Unilever, has produced chicken seasoning powder with 25% less sodium content. And I don’t think it costs more. 19.     MOH will continue to work with the food companies and F&B outlets, some of you represented here, to increase the range and variety of lower-sodium salt, sauces and seasonings. 20.     Producers of beverages are also reformulating their drinks, to cut down on sugar content, and incorporating suitable labels to guide consumers on their choices. 21.     In time, we should also see the advent of a more affordable range of plant-based foods. Plant-based food, especially plant-based meat, currently is indeed more expensive, but I hope not for long. Singapore currently leads the Asian market in terms of plant-based food consumption, and more sustainable plant-based meats are making its way to our local supermarkets and restaurants, and I hope prices will moderate over time. 22.     For instance, The Vegetarian Butcher, a Dutch brand, has partnered The Social Kitchen in Singapore to offer plant-based meat alternatives in its restaurant menu. 23.     In a food haven like Singapore where people have acquired a sophisticated taste for food, I believe there are tremendous opportunities to develop a vibrant and healthy food scene. And I look forward to your contributions to that. Exercise 24.     Second, exercise. 25.     Like food, exercise need not be expensive and inaccessible, requiring coaches and personal trainers for example, personal yoga trainers. None of that. It is really about standing instead of sitting, taking the stairs, going for regular brisk walks or jogs or cycling trips, cutting back on our device time, we are just simply watching too much of that, and leading a much less sedentary lifestyle. All these do not cost much. 26.     The biggest determinant of exercise is personal initiative and discipline. Our Health Promotion Board runs a very successful National Steps Challenge. It is the world’s first population-level fitness tracker-based activity to encourage Singaporeans to move about more. Today, it has over 700,000 participants, or one-fifth of our adult population. Nine in 10 of them took up the challenge with self-organised exercise activities – they do not need coaches, or personal trainers. 27.     The National Steps Challenge became a success. If we are honest, it is because we use technology appropriately, so that it becomes accessible, easy to join, easy to follow, with a very simple and affordable to the government incentive system. It involves wearables, apps and then an AI engine that nudges us to keep up our good exercise habits. 28.     Today, we are seeing an explosion of digital apps that promise to enhance preventive care. Beyond exercise, they can help you regulate your sleep patterns, your eating habits, so on and so forth. 29.     There are also digital diagnostics, to help patients better manage their chronic conditions. Abbott, Indigo and Philips have all developed solutions for remote monitoring of patients, so they have become great partners for all our doctors. Doctors see you once every half a year, but you have your apps with you, day-in, day-out, monitoring and making sure you are doing the right things, keeping your chronic illness in check. Diabetic patients can now have a sensor placed under their skin to measure their glucose levels, helping them keep their glucose levels in check. 30.     If we can incorporate all these innovations with an overarching national promotion effort, we can make great strides in enhancing population health. Employee’s Welfare 31.     Finally, becoming healthier can also be a matter of enhancing your employees’ welfare. Afterall, a healthier workforce is a more productive workforce. 32.     Our workplace is a very important part of our social circles, and a very natural touchpoint to encourage people to change their living habits. Over the years, we have worked with companies to put in place various workplace wellness programmes. 33.     Companies have also stepped up to initiate ways to promote mental wellness in your workplaces. SCOR, a member of EuroCham, organises well-being programmes, such as yoga and meditation, for its employees. SCOR has also established a mental wellness line to assist employees who need help and implemented a ‘Friday no-meetings’ day. 34.     The COVID-19 pandemic had disrupted some of these programmes when many of our employees worked from home. With employees now returning to workplaces, I hope companies will double down on re-introducing many of these programmes for self-care, fitness and wellness. 35.     When Healthier SG is ready to roll out, I hope in the middle of next year, I hope companies will encourage your employees to enrol in the programme, activate your panel doctors to support the national initiative, and consider introducing small incentives to drive better health and well-being of your employees. Closing 36.     The EuroCham has been an important stakeholder and partner of Singapore all these years. It shares our national concerns over a range of topics. My last conversation with you was over free trade and openness, and even as we weather the COVID-19 pandemic, we make an effort to engage each other on such important topics. 37.     I thank the Chamber for giving me the opportunity to share with you the Healthier SG strategy, and how I think the members of EuroCham can play a significant role in this national healthcare reform strategy. I look forward to forging an even stronger partnership with you, through Healthier SG. Thank you very much.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-eurocham-launch-of-the-future-of-healthcare-wellbeing-whitebook-30-may-2022,

I am heartened to see our key partners involved in the War on Diabetes, including Diabetes Singapore and healthcare professionals from our public healthcare institutions, come together to support the Type 1 Diabetes community.2.   Over the past two years, COVID-19 has proven the strength of our unity as we fight together as one nation. As we take steps towards normalcy, we must continue to make inroads in our fight against diabetes. Type 1 diabetes in Singapore3.   Locally, one in three individuals in Singapore is at risk of developing diabetes in their lifetime. If nothing is done, by 2050, it is estimated that about one million Singaporeans will be living with diabetes. Although Type 1 diabetes is less common compared to Type 2 diabetes, it remains important to address the specific needs for managing this condition well.4.   Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, and lifelong insulin replacement remains the only treatment modality available currently. As optimal management of the condition requires daily insulin injections, frequent glucose monitoring and structured patient education, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has put in place various measures to improve access to treatment,  as well as knowledge and support to bring about improved treatment outcomes and quality of life for those living with Type 1 diabetes.Improving Access to Treatment5.   As insulin replacement and frequent glucose monitoring are key to managing Type 1 diabetes, MOH has been subsidising insulin, insulin pumps and certain consumables for patients at our public healthcare institutions, allowing them to be more affordable to patients. 6.   All Singaporeans are eligible for means-tested subsidies under the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) at GP clinics for the treatment of chronic conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme (CDMP), including Type 1 diabetes. To defray the cost of treatment, individuals can also withdraw up to $500 or $700 yearly from MediSave for the treatment of their conditions at public healthcare institutions and accredited GP clinics under CDMP, depending on the complexity of their condition. Those aged 60 and above can withdraw up to $300 more under Flexi-MediSave.7.   The Agency for Care Effectiveness (ACE) established by MOH will continue to facilitate negotiations on prices of drugs and devices using evidence-based health technology assessments. This will help patients, including those with Type 1 diabetes, increase access to treatments that will improve treatment outcomes and their quality of life.8.   We want to also thank Diabetes Singapore in enabling patients in need to access care packs which allow them to self-administer insulin injections safely, thus enabling better self-management and optimising diabetes control.Improving Access to Knowledge and Support9.   Under the War on Diabetes effort, we have developed the National Diabetes Reference Materials (NDRM) which provides a set of consistent resources on HealthHub for care teams and patients to understand diabetes and motivate patients for sustained lifestyle changes. With feedback gathered from engaging citizens on potential knowledge gaps, we are developing Tier 2 of NDRM, which includes information on Type 1 diabetes. Through patient education and patient empowerment on self-management, we hope to encourage individuals to take charge of their health and achieve positive outcomes. 10.   I am heartened to know that this book is written after many interviews with families with members with Type 1 diabetes, and takes a child’s perspective in understanding as well as managing diabetes. The wide distribution channels across all primary schools, pre-schools, and paediatric hospitals would help to create greater awareness of Type 1 diabetes, in particular to benefit the younger patients by helping them better understand their own condition.Closing11.   To those living with Type 1 diabetes, I commend you on your strength in managing your condition and I wish for you to live your lives to the fullest. To caregivers and service providers, you have played an immense role in supporting those living with Type 1 diabetes.12.   I wish Diabetes Singapore and typeOne.sg a successful book launch.

This is our 23rd polyclinic, and part of our continued efforts to strengthen primary care capacity. 2..     Let me first express my deepest gratitude to all our healthcare professionals at Eunos Polyclinic for being part of the battle against COVID-19. The Polyclinic started ramping up for opening during the Delta infection wave late last year. So, it was plunged into the deep end. It has not been an easy journey, but you have risen to the challenge, and I thank the staff of Eunos Polyclinic for your important contributions. Methodist Welfare Services Senior Care Centre 3.     We have also been co-locating polyclinics with our health-related services. Today I would like to recognise the good neighbour of Eunos Polyclinic, which is the Senior Care Centre operated by the Methodist Welfare Services (MWS). 4.     MWS has over 40 years of community service in Singapore, and currently serves more than 8,000 beneficiaries through their 21 centres. This is MWS’ first Senior Care Centre, and I am confident that the two institutions will synergise their work to serve our residents better. 5.     Through MWS, the Polyclinic can now better encourage active ageing by organising appropriate health and wellness activities, such as health talks and healthy cooking demonstrations for our seniors. Team-Based Care in Chronic Disease Management 6.     With the COVID-19 situation stabilised, our polyclinics have been focusing on non-pandemic workload. We are working upstream to better manage the rise and increasing complexity of chronic disease management. 7.     This is why the future of healthcare is in primary care. Today, let me talk about an important aspect of primary care, which is delivering care through multi-disciplinary teams. 8.     Our polyclinics, including Eunos Polyclinic, have harnessed the strength of teamwork. 9.     A team-based care system is based on two beliefs. First, by tapping on the expertise and competencies of different professionals, we can deliver better outcomes for the people we serve. Second, by assigning a dedicated team to a patient as far as possible, we build a strong relationship between the team and the patient, and that is fundamental to better care for the patient. 10.     A typical team has up to three family physicians, whose core responsibility is to adopt a relationship-based approach in good chronic disease management. With good relationship, comes trust; with trust, comes the patient’s willingness to heed the advice of the doctor. Then patients can be empowered to self-monitor and self-care. Indeed, a big part of better health outcomes stems from each of us being responsible for our own health, and learn how to do so with the help of our doctors. 11.     There will also typically be a registered nurse trained in chronic disease management who is the care manager, whose duty is to provide chronic disease counselling, teach patients self-management skills and manage stable chronic conditions in collaboration with the doctor. 12.     Another member acts as the care coordinator, who will provide pre-consultation screening of the patient, to find out if he has underlying chronic diseases, taken his relevant vaccinations, and state of mental health and frailty. 13.     There may also be a care coach, who will look into social aspects of health. The coach may have to tap into external support to address issues within the family, or help the patient adjust their lifestyles. Other resources available to the team include allied health professionals and hospital specialists. The care team must know that the entire healthcare system is supporting their work to care for patients. Model of Care 14.     With a team-based approach, the model of care changes. So a typical journey of a patient may look like this. 15.     First, when a patient with chronic illness visits the polyclinic, he will measure his blood pressure, height and weight using the self-help machines at the polyclinic. 16.     Then, the polyclinic will assess their medical complexity and other social needs. Depending on his control, the patient could be reviewed by a nurse clinician if stable and well controlled. If it is a more complex case, he will be immediately attended by a doctor. 17.     As the team reviewed the complex case, it may prescribe tests such as diabetic eye and foot screenings, which they are now empowered to order. The nurse counsellor will provide individualised health education to optimise blood sugar control and check that follow-up appointments are booked. 18.     After the patient leaves the clinic, a telecare nurse may contact him before his next visit to the polyclinic. The nurse will review the patient’s lifestyle habits, suggest adjustments, and remind him to take his medications. 19.     This is one example. Others may have difference experiences, depending on their conditions. Through the team-based approach, polyclinics try to deliver care that is as customised as possible, according to patients’ care needs. 20.     I believe private family doctors also see value in a team-based approach. Many are now part of Primary Care Networks, where they can tap on each other’s support. I understand that many private family doctors are also visiting our polyclinics, to draw reference from best practices in team-based care. Support from the Community 21.     It is important to recognise that in team-based care, there needs to be an extended team beyond the polyclinic. Because everyone of us spends much more time in our home, workplace and community than at a healthcare facility. So good healthcare requires the support of the community. 22.     To better assist patients with complex medical and social care needs, SingHealth Polyclinics piloted the Primary Care Based Integrated Community Care Teams programme at Marine Parade Polyclinic. 23.     In this programme, SingHealth Polyclinics care teams collaborated with partners from across the health and social sectors, including SingHealth Community Nursing, Changi General Hospital Neighbours for Active Living, and Montfort Care GoodLife!. These partners played distinct roles in the management of the patient’s medical and social wellbeing, in the community. 24.     In the initial pilot, despite the majority of patients having at least three chronic conditions, more than 80% of these patients benefited from better blood sugar control six months after enrolling in the programme. More than two-thirds of patients demonstrated an improvement in their knowledge, skills, and confidence in managing their own health and well-being. 25.     Indeed, other studies showed that over three years, patients cared for by polyclinic teams showed significant positive clinical outcomes, compared to other patients. This includes better diabetes control, fewer specialist outpatient clinic visits, fewer visits to emergency departments, and fewer hospital admissions. 26.     With the support of team, patients also generally take better care of themselves. Interestingly, when surveyed, many patients cared for by teams reflected that some of their social and family issues that affected their health have been addressed. Somehow, as the conditions of patients improved, they also took steps and efforts to resolve some of their social and family issues. Better team care begets better self-care, and vice versa. 27.     Given the success of the pilot programme, SingHealth Polyclinics will progressively extend the programme to its remaining eight SingHealth Polyclinics, including Eunos Polyclinic. Closing 28.     I would like to congratulate SingHealth Polyclinics on the official opening of Eunos Polyclinic and thank all the staff for your commitment to serve the residents here. 29.     Other than the unveiling of a spanking new facility, what is equally important is the emergence of new models of care that will benefit our patients, raise the morale and heighten the mission and purpose of healthcare workers, and bring about a healthier population. ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-official-opening-of-eunos-polyclinic-6-june-2022,

Gubler,"        Singapore has honoured Professor K Ranga Rama Krishnan, Chairman of the National Medical Research Council (NMRC), and Professor Duane J. Gubler, Emeritus Professor at Duke-NUS Medical School, with the Honorary Citizen Award for their valuable contributions to Singapore. President Halimah Yacob conferred the Award on Professor Krishnan and Professor Gubler at a ceremony held at the Istana today.2.     The Award is the highest form of recognition bestowed by the Singapore Government for outstanding contributions by individuals to the country’s growth and development. It is conferred on those who have made a significant impact in the areas of business, science and technology, information communications, education, health, arts and culture, sports, tourism, community services or security. Please refer to Annex A for more information on the Honorary Citizen Award, and Annex B for the biographies of the awardees.Professor K Ranga Rama Krishnan3.     Professor Ranga Krishnan is Chairman of the NMRC of the Ministry of Health (MOH), and Chief Executive Officer of the Rush University System for Health in the United States of America. 4.     As the longest serving Chairman of the NMRC Board, Professor Krishnan guided NMRC to formulate and implement strategies to promote excellence in health and biomedical sciences, leading to impactful outcomes for Singapore. In particular, he strengthened NMRC’s support of translational research in key areas such as ageing and health services research, and also helped develop innovation and commercialisation of research. This included the setting up of the National Health Innovation Centre Singapore in 2014, of which he was the founding Chairman.  5.     As Dean of Duke-NUS from 2008 to 2015, he was instrumental in laying the foundations for the school and the broader SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre. He also served as Member of the SingHealth Board from 2013 to 2022, helping to steer the academic medicine partnership between SingHealth and Duke-NUS to become a leader in medical research and education in Singapore and beyond.6.     Professor Krishnan was Chairman of the Singapore Clinical Research Institute and Board Member of the Health Sciences Authority, both of which benefitted greatly from his extensive experience and expertise in clinical trials and regulatory science. His influence also led to the establishment of the Centre of Regulatory Excellence at Duke-NUS, which is the first dedicated centre in Asia targeted to the needs of national health regulators and other stakeholders. 7.     Professor Krishnan also served on various national research oversight committees, including the Human Health and Potential Executive Committee and the A*STAR Biomedical Research Council. In these roles, he provided guidance and critical insights towards the formulation of national research and biomedical sciences strategies.8.     Professor Krishnan said, “I am humbled and deeply grateful to receive the Honorary Citizen Award and to join a very respected group of recipients. Singapore gave me an unique, once in a lifetime opportunity to be part of building a new medical school, and a truly outstanding academic health system. I am thankful for that opportunity and for the chance to participate in the transformation of Singapore’s health system and biotech sector to be a true global leader. I would like to express my gratitude to the many individuals, through these many years from A*STAR, Duke-NUS, MOH, Ministry of Education, Ministry of Trade and Industry, National Research Foundation, National University of Singapore, and SingHealth, too many to enumerate, whose support and friendship made it all possible.”Professor Duane J. Gubler 9.     Professor Duane J. Gubler is an Emeritus Professor and Founding Director of the Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) Programme at Duke-NUS Medical School. He is also the Chair of National Environment Agency (NEA)’s Dengue Expert Advisory Panel, which guides NEA’s research team in developing and piloting the novel Wolbachia technology.10.    Singapore’s partnership with Professor Gubler dates back to the 1970s, when he attended a dengue meeting held here by the World Health Organization. Since then, he has played a pivotal role in shaping Singapore’s public health strategies, serving on numerous expert advisory panels for MOH and NEA. He advocated fostering strong political will to control infectious diseases, and proposed a government-community partnership for dengue control, emphasising public education, removal of stagnant water, and robust surveillance. His advice forms the foundation of Singapore’s dengue control programme today. Beyond dengue, Professor Gubler led the establishment of the EID programme at Duke-NUS and institutionalised the lessons learned from Singapore’s experience with SARS in 2003 and H1N1 influenza in 2009. Thanks to this effort, Singapore’s COVID-19 response has been lauded by many around the world for its high level of readiness and efficiency.  11.     Many young scientists in Singapore have also been inspired by Professor Gubler and benefited from his guidance. At Duke-NUS, he was selfless in sharing his wealth of knowledge in research, especially to early career scientists, helping to shape and nurture the local research landscape in the field of virology and medical entomology. Professor Gubler’s deep and generously offered insights also strengthened the scientific capabilities of NEA’s Environmental Health Institute during its formative years. He continues to contribute to Singapore as the Chair of NEA’s Dengue Expert Advisory Panel. The Panel has guided NEA’s research team in developing and piloting the novel Wolbachia technology, which has since successfully reduced dengue risk in the study sites.12.     Professor Gubler said, “Words cannot convey how humbled I am to receive Honorary Citizenship from a great country like Singapore. I am deeply greatly honoured to receive this award. My first visit to Singapore was over 50 years ago, before shopping centres and high-rise condos and hotels dotted the skyline. I have watched Singapore evolve into a global public health and economic leader, becoming a model for other countries to emulate. I am proud to have been a part of this evolution, but any contribution I may have made must be attributed to the many Singaporean colleagues and friends whom I have worked with over the years. I humbly thank them for making this award possible and will do my best to live up to the honour conferred on me today.”MINISTRY OF HEALTH NATIONAL ENVIRONMENT AGENCY9 JUNE 2022",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/honorary-citizen-award-conferred-on-professor-k-ranga-rama-krishnan-and-professor-duane-j.-gubler,

Vaccine protection against severe disease from three doses is also lower in persons aged 80 years and older, and a second booster is important to achieve a high level of protection. As such, the EC19V strongly urges persons in these recommended groups to receive the second booster vaccination as soon as they are eligible.4.  Data has shown that the risk of severe COVID-19 can increase in persons aged 50 years and older. As such, the second booster can now be offered to all persons aged 50 years and older to further increase their protection. This is an update from the previous position of the second booster being offered to all persons aged 60 years and older. All persons aged 80 years and older are strongly recommended to get their second booster, as previously recommended. The second booster should be given around five months after the first booster. 5.  To facilitate uptake of the second booster, EC19V further recommends that persons aged 18 years and older, who have health conditions that make them medically vulnerable to severe COVID-19, can receive the second booster without the need for a physician’s referral. They can self-declare their health condition to be eligible for the second booster (please refer to the Annex for the list of health conditions). This is an update from the previous arrangement where such persons were required to provide a doctor’s referral to receive the second booster. The list of health conditions in the Annex covers medical conditions of concern, but is not exhaustive. Persons with medical conditions not listed in the Annex, or who are not sure if they are included in the listed groups should consult their doctor.  They may then proceed to receive the second booster based on their doctor’s advice if the doctor provides an appropriate referral. Extending the Recommended Primary Vaccination Series Dosing Interval6.  The recommended dosing intervals between the first two doses of a COVID-19 primary vaccination series had been set at 21 to 28 days depending on the vaccine used. This was based on the vaccination protocols used in their respective vaccine trials, and also due to a need to expedite protection against COVID-19 for a vaccine-naive population during the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.7.  There is now more evidence that an extended interval between the first two doses of the primary vaccination series may confer better immune response and vaccine effectiveness. EC19V is thus now recommending for the dosing interval to be extended to eight weeks between the first two doses of the primary vaccination series for all COVID-19 vaccines[1] available under the National Vaccination Programme, for those who have yet to be vaccinated with their primary vaccination series.8. Individuals, particularly those who are at risk of exposure to COVID-19 or more susceptible to severe disease, may still receive the doses earlier than the eight-week interval but not less than the previously established minimum intervals[2].9. All eligible individuals are strongly encouraged to complete the COVID-19 primary vaccination series and booster vaccinations recommended for them, if they have not done so already. EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION10 JUNE 2022[1] Vaccines available under the National Vaccination Programme are: Pfizer-BionTech/Comirnaty, Moderna/Spikevax, Novavax/Nuvaxovid and Sinovac-Coronavac.[2]The minimum intervals that the first two doses of the vaccines should be taken are: 21 days for Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Novavax/Nuvaxovid, 28 days for Moderna/Spikevax and Sinovac-CoronaVac.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/groups-eligible-for-second-booster-and-dosing-interval-for-covid-19-primary-vaccination-series,

It has been a difficult year for the whole sector due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 2.            We all know that the virus affects seniors the most. That means that the community care sector bore disproportionate responsibility, burden and stress during the pandemic. 3.            We sometimes read stories of how the COVID-19 pandemic swept through the nursing homes (NHs) in some countries, leading to many deaths and casualties. In Singapore we have largely avoided that. Because MOH, AIC, our hospitals and NHs have worked closely together, and have protected our seniors as best as we can, primarily through infection control measures and more importantly, vaccinations. 4.            At some point, after speaking to leaders of NHs, MOH decided to back up the sector with Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) to encourage residents to receive their vaccinations, so that they can receive visitors. That was during the height of the infection waves. And that, I believe, encouraged more of our residents to take up the vaccinations. Some of the responses to this policy were very negative and sharp, but it was the right thing to do and probably saved many lives. 5.            Today, we have rolled out COVID-19 vaccinations to over 90% of eligible NH residents and Senior Care Centre (SCC) clients, as well as over 10,000 home care clients. 6.            A great part of our success in responding to COVID-19 therefore depends on how we have protected our seniors. So I want to start by thanking everyone for your tremendous effort and sacrifices over the past two and a half years. It was an exemplary demonstration of dedication, commitment and professionalism of the sector. Preparing for the Next Infection Wave 7.            The pandemic is however not over. We must expect new infection waves, new variants of concern, and at some point, even a new pandemic. 8.            In the short term, we should expect a new infection wave, and we think it is likely in July or August this year. This is because our current high level of immunity, accumulated from both vaccinations and natural infections from the recent Omicron BA.2 wave, will start to wane. When it does, the most dominant prevailing COVID-19 strain, most likely BA.4 or BA.5, will start to multiply and drive infection numbers. 9.            But infection numbers matter much less than the number of people who fall severely ill and need to be hospitalised. So long as we can protect our hospital capacity, we will be able to ride through a new infection wave smoothly, without imposing any significant social restrictions. That should be our aim. 10.        Remember, vaccinations give our bodies a few layers of defense. Even if the first layer to prevent infections wanes after a few months, there are further layers to prevent us from falling very sick if infected. 11.        International evidence and our own data show that protection against severe illness and hospitalisation continues to be very strong many months after the first booster shot. 12.        We will monitor the situation closely and stay prepared. MOH will also need the help of the community care sector to undertake three key tasks in preparation of the new infection waves. 13.        First, every healthcare setting will need to be COVID-19 ready. During the recent Omicron Wave, NHs worked tirelessly with AIC to look after their infected residents on site, under the Care@NH initiative. 14.        You had to swiftly set up cohort spaces, step up care protocols to intensify monitoring of infected residents, provide stepped-up medical treatment, swiftly triage and escalate cases, and manage the concerns of anxious loved ones and next-of-kin (NOK). 15.        Apex Harmony Lodge (AHL), Sunlove and Surya were one of the first NHs to care for infected residents on-site. They felt that their residents, who are persons with dementia, would recover better in a familiar environment, rather than being transferred to a hospital which can be stressful and confusing. Such resident-centric consideration is a key motivation of NHs who have similarly stepped up to Care@NH. 16.        Since February this year, over 4,700 residents infected with COVID-19 have been cared for on-site in NHs. Imagine if they had all been transferred to hospitals. Our hospitals were very strained, but they were not overwhelmed. 17.        Currently, over 80% of NHs, including the two inpatient hospices, are on board the Care@NH programme. MOH will work with the remaining homes, so that by the time the next wave arrives, they are all ready. For residents who are at higher risk or have more complex conditions, be assured that they will still be escalated to acute hospitals. 18.        Second, we need NHs to continue to actively accept transfers of patients from acute and community hospitals. There are still many patients who no longer need acute care in hospitals, but nevertheless are staying in hospitals while they wait for vacancies at NHs. 19.        Since April this year, we have opened more NHs, and the sector is collectively accepting about 300 new admissions each month from acute and community hospitals. I thank you for your support, especially in the face of a bad manpower crunch, but please continue to work closely with our hospitals. 20.        Third, and probably most importantly, we need to ensure that all our residents get their booster shots. Although we gain fully vaccinated status after two shots of mRNA vaccine, against the Omicron variant, we, and especially the seniors amongst us, need three shots of mRNA vaccine. 21.        Let me cite you some numbers. For those above 60 years old and have not received their primary series, the incidence of severe illness and death after Omicron infection is almost four in 100. For those not boosted nine months after their primary series, incidence rate is one in 100. For those boosted, the incidence rate drops to three in 1,000. The booster shot is critical, especially for our seniors. 22.        Omicron is therefore a dangerous disease for seniors who are not fully vaccinated and boosted. 23.        In the next one month, we need to work hard to get all our seniors boosted with a third shot. For those who are older or immune-compromised, we recommend a fourth shot. For the minority who may be concerned about receiving another mRNA shot, we now have a good alternative in the Novavax vaccine, which is based on more traditional technology. 24.        Let us work together closely, to get these critical tasks done. Major Roles of Community Care in Healthcare 25.        Let me now go beyond COVID-19, to talk about the role of the community care sector in healthcare, especially in the light of the Healthier SG strategy. 26.        It is a role of rising importance, because of our ageing population. There will be many more aged sick, who need to be looked after within families, in hospitals, communities and NHs. 27.        Some have asked me: What is the role of the community care sector in Healthier SG? Healthier SG is very much a strategy to address the escalating strains of an ageing population. So to be honest, the community care sector will actually bear the brunt of this tremendous demographic change. You are front and centre of this national challenge! 28.        Just look at the capacity expansion of the sector to get a sense of the scale of this challenge. Between 2010 and 2020, we expanded NH beds from about 9,600 to 16,200 - a 70% increase. In the next 10 years, we plan to increase capacity by close to another 100%, to more than 31,000. 29.        MOH constantly asks ourselves: Is this rate of increase sustainable? Other than expanding NH beds, we need to take decisive steps to right site aged care, away from acute hospitals, community hospitals and NHs.  30.        I believe Healthier SG will work to ensure that more seniors can age healthily, live independently and happily. We need new senior care models to allow more seniors, even those who require assistance with daily activities, to age and be cared for in their own homes or in the community. We also need to support caregivers, physically and emotionally. They are making great personal sacrifices and are often under-appreciated by families and the society. 31.        One important move is to expand both the scale and scope of the services of Eldercare Centres (ECs), to support ageing in place, in communities and our own homes. It is not a panacea, but will help anchor and support care in the community. 32.        We have already rolled out 119 ECs so far. It is the largest ground community asset that MOH has. ECs are important community touchpoints for healthy and pre-frail seniors. They help seniors meet their ABC needs, i.e. active ageing, befriending, and referral to care services. 33.        By 2025, we aim to almost double the number of ECs to 220, to ensure sufficient coverage across the island. 34.        In addition, we will increase the scope of services in ECs. For instance, seniors today may visit their GPs and polyclinics once every few months for their chronic conditions. In between these visits, seniors can visit the ECs to engage in health-related activities or enrol in active ageing programmes. In time, we would like ECs to help seniors monitor their vitals, do simple health screenings that do not require the presence of doctors, and link up with other service and healthcare providers. 35.        Eventually, each EC should be responsible for the 1,000 to 4,000 seniors under their charge, and work with community networks such as grassroots and People’s Association, Social Service Offices, and GPs, to address seniors’ health-social needs. 36.        Another important move is to increase the supply of good quality end-of-life care at home, in centres and hospices. For a long time, end-of-life care was a taboo topic, but I am glad that we are more ready to openly talk about it now. 37.        Most of us prefer to pass on in a familiar environment, surrounded by loved ones, instead of in hospitals. But few of us actually do so when the time comes. So we are not quite fulfilling the wishes of individuals, while stressing our health institutions. 38.        Over the last few years, we have tested and integrated new models of care between hospital and home. We will have to do more for palliative care to be further anchored in the community. 39.        NHs will be a key partner in this effort. NH residents will not want to go through multiple transitions to and fro hospitals towards the end of their lives, as it can be very distressing. 40.        For NHs involved in the recent end-of-life pilot programme, I hope you would have seen the benefits of your efforts. AIC will work with more NHs to onboard this effort. 41.        To do this, we will work with NHs to build up their skills and confidence in managing end-of-life journeys, including attending to the health symptoms, facilitating Advance Care Planning, and providing emotional support to residents and their family members.  42.        I know this is a major shift for many NHs. But when I think about the resident-centric motivation behind how you quickly came on board Care@NH, I believe that you will rise to the occasion here too. AIC and MOH will support you as much as we can. Building Up our People 43.        Finally, let me talk about manpower, which is our most severe constraint in achieving what I just set out, and a major concern for community care providers. 44.        We will need to continue to depend on the commitment of staff in the community care sector to deliver quality care and services for our seniors. We will need to retain as well as attract good staff. This requires a combination of measures. 45.        First, salary competitiveness is a major factor. We have embarked on the Community Care Salary Enhancement exercise and have committed about $290 million to raise the salaries of Community Care Organisations (CCO) staff from 2020 to 2023. This will ensure that their salaries remain competitive against the public healthcare sector and the market. This will close the gap meaningfully. 46.        Second, MOH and AIC will continue to invest in skills development of the sector’s workforce. AIC’s Learning Institutes have scaled up its offerings, with more than 18,000 training places offered annually. 47.        Third, we are also working on transforming existing roles through job redesign for non-clinical manpower and digitalisation, to increase productivity and value of the jobs. We are embarking on a Community Care Digital Transformation Plan. It will help remove repetitive and administrative tasks, and will be a meaingful support structure for our partners and for Healthier SG. 48.        Finally, we still need foreign healthcare manpower. I am a big believer in using technology and digital health to improve preventive care and adjust lifestyles, but community care is inherently a very high touch sector. There is a limit to replacing physical manpower with technology and digital solutions. 49.        Hence, our manpower needs will continue to increase amidst an ageing population, even as our cohort sizes are falling. We will need to complement our local workforce, especially for nurses and support care staff, with foreign manpower. This is a difficult and sensitive topic, and I will be happy to hear your views and answer any queries during our panel discussion later. Closing 50.        The healthcare sector is undergoing a big transformation because of two massive challenges before us. In the short term – COVID-19, and in the long-term – ageing.  51.        We need to do things differently, support each other to rise above these challenges. We will need resources, manpower, determination and hard work. But more importantly, we need to count on each other, and count on every Singaporean to do our part. We will be there to provide the key support. This is ultimately our most important success factor.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-2022-community-care-work-plan-seminar-on-13-june-2022-9am,

It is a pleasure to be here with you today.2.     It has been a while since I addressed a big group of students face-to-face. It is something I really enjoyed doing as Education Minister. I hope I have not become too rusty. 3.     Today we are talking about youths navigating a post-pandemic world. A pertinent topic. 4.     At your age, I lived through the Cold War. There were movies made about nuclear holocaust and at some point, I thought this would be our fate and I might not have a future. Then the Berlin Wall came down and that was the start of the end of the Cold War. I was studying overseas then, and with a female friend, made a trip to Berlin and symbolically joined the wall hacking. We are now married with two kids. 5.     Nuclear war did not happen. Globalisation did; China opened up to the world; the Internet and social media came about; the climate started to warm up; every blockbuster is now a superhero movie; Singapore grew and matured, and here we are. There are still lots of problems in the world, but life is not a disaster, and – depending on your perspective – not too bad at all. 6.     And then the biggest global crisis – COVID-19 – struck. Every country in the world is affected. I do not have to describe to you the paralysis, despair and deprivation that followed. The pandemic is not over but the dust has settled, and most countries are now living with COVID-19. 7.     Thanks to our collective efforts and trust in each other, Singapore came out of it with one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. 8.     What is next? Will the BC or Before COVID world, and the AD or After Disease world, be more of the same or different? 9.     I argue that it has to be different. We have to make it different, for the better, or we would have wasted the global crisis. I cannot speak for every facet of life, but let me speak briefly about the sectors I was involved in. 10.     As Education Minister I tried my best not to close schools when fear was at its height. Because I felt that while the affluent can afford home tuition, the masses cannot, and prolonged loss of school time will have long-term detrimental effects on the children. Further, parents need children to go to school so that they can go to work. 11.     So we kept schools opened, but without fun things like CCAs, sports competition and playground activities. When the Circuit Breaker had to be implemented, we closed school for a month, by switching to home-based learning. We managed to do that because digital learning was already years in the making when COVID-19 struck. It was meant to enhance the classroom experience with digital tools, but we repurposed it for home-based learning. 12.     Within that month, digital lessons proliferated, children became digitally equipped, parents got involved in education, and teachers gained confidence in delivering lessons online. As we emerged from the Circuit Breaker, we enhanced digital learning in school, as a permanent feature of school experience. We equipped every secondary school student with a digital device. We introduced a fortnightly self-directed learning day, where students learn from home, independently, doing research, reading or project work.13.     All these were always in MOE’s plans, but to be implemented much later, around 2028. COVID-19 brought it forward by 6 to 7 years. 14.     Something similar happened at the Ministry of Transport. When I took up post as Minister for Transport, we were deep into the pandemic. I could not insist on keeping our airport opened. Borders were closed, and Changi Airport became a ghost town. But it brought to the fore the strategic importance of our air hub. We found ways to keep the airport humming along, including air travel bubbles and cargo transport. 15.     With reduced traffic, the air was cleaner and I thought the sky was bluer and sunsets more colourful. A few ministries took the opportunity to come together to launch the Singapore Green Plan. We are a small country and cannot make a huge difference to climate change but at least we can be the urban city with the right climate-friendly policies which other cities can use as a reference. 16.     On MOT’s part, we set ourselves to convert our car population substantively to run on cleaner energy, by 2040. Few countries have set such ambitious plans but we are in a unique position to do this because of our COE system. 17.     As people worked from home, and social activities were restricted, peak hour traffic plunged. Even today, after we have removed almost all restrictions, peak hour traffic is not at the same level as before COVID-19. This is a positive development. We should try to find ways to embrace a suitable level of flexi work arrangements, and also spread out traffic during the day, for a more sustainable way of commuting. This pivot would not have been possible without COVID-19.18.     The Ministry of Health is where we found our world turned upside down. COVID-19 however, has led to some unprecedented changes in care-seeking behavior and how healthcare is delivered. 19.     People now truly appreciate the importance of hygiene, wearing of masks to prevent illness, and taking vaccinations. With social restrictions, more people picked up exercising. All these are important aspects of preventive care which no amount of peace time public education campaign could bring about. 20.     Our family doctors – mostly private GPs – became part of the public healthcare response system. They attend to COVID-19 patients, test them, triage them, and decide if they should recover at home or a healthcare facility. Without GPs we would not have been able to cope with the Delta and Omicron waves.21.     It was also during the pandemic that most Singaporeans – whether youths like you or the aunties and uncles who are not digital natives – saw the role that technology can play in healthcare. Telemedicine became more widely accepted because people can see the doctor in the comfort of their own homes. TraceTogether, SafeEntry and HealthHub apps, which became our constant COVID-19 companions. They became indispensable apps alongside our TikTok, Spotify and YouTube apps. 22.     These are profound developments, compressed in a short few months, which prompted us to launch the Healthier SG strategy. It will focus on preventive care, to keep our population healthy. We will sustain the momentum of family doctors like GPs being a critical part of the public healthcare system, to enrol all residents above 40 for preventive care programmes. Besides drug prescription, family doctors will prescribe regular health screening, and offer social prescriptions, to urge their patients to eat, sleep and exercise better. 23.     Between regular visits to our family doctors, we hope everyone will continue to have healthcare apps, complemented by wearables, to nudge us to live more healthily. As it is, 700,000 adult Singapore residents have downloaded the Healthy 365 app under the National Steps Challenge. 24.     Healthier SG is a pivotal and major transformation of how we deliver healthcare. It is something MOH has always wanted to do, but COVID-19 gave us a golden opportunity to accelerate the implementation. 25.     Beyond the three Ministries I was assigned to during the pandemic, I believe many more opportunities abound, to do things differently, to accelerate transformation plans. 26.     These are all work-related. At a personal level, I am trying to live a better post COVID-19 life too. Like many others, I spend a lot more time with my family during the pandemic, as community events were cancelled, and social activities were curtailed. It has helped me value family time more and realised I have not spent enough time with them. 27.     In my home I have a little study room, where I do my work, physical exercises, sit on my armchair and play my vinyl records. My wife said that because of COVID-19, I have emerged from my man-cave, to spend more time with my loved ones at the dining table, or in the living room, even while I still work on my computer. 28.     What about you? How has life changed for you? I think it really depends on how you see the situation and what you decide to do about it. 29.     You missed out a lot on school experiences due to COVID-19. Athletes could not participate in the National School Games; overseas trips and internships got cancelled or cut short; prom nights and graduation trips could not go ahead; and there was no proper commencement ceremony to mark the milestone of your graduation. 30.     It is a pity. But we have to let go of what is lost and what we cannot control. Instead, given that you could not do what students normally do, what did you do that was abnormal and out of the ordinary? If you have done so, very good for you. If you have not done so, it is not too late to start. Do something that can make life different and better, just as we are trying to make education, transport and healthcare different.31.     Let the post COVID-19 world bring out the best in you. And we have seen that happen amidst of the outbreak. Students delivered food to those who were quarantined, gave up their rooms for dormitory workers and led them to do morning exercises every day, marched into the community to help people in need, joined our pandemic operations to answer public phone calls or man vaccination centres, or simply cheer on our healthcare workers. 32.     Singapore emerged well from the abyss of the pandemic because everyone, including youths, played their part. Even as we exit the pandemic, I hope you continue to hold on to that sense of purpose and conviction that you can play a part to make the world around you a better place.33.     Now, all of you have the honour of being the generation that went through school life during the pandemic. You lost something, but you also gained a lot, in terms of grit, resilience and a strong sense of social responsibility. 34.     My generation lived through the Cold War which fortunately did not escalate into a nuclear war. We did not know what the future would be. Years later the world is still standing, with some things made better but other things worse.35.     Guess what? My generation still does not know what the future will be, and we are all still learning, trying to contribute, and make things better. 36.     Yours is living through other challenges – heightened risk of geopolitical conflict, climate change and technology reshaping the way we live our lives. Then the worst global pandemic crisis the modern world has experienced hit you. It is all somewhat daunting and uncertain. 37.     If you do not know what the future brings, rest assured it is normal. Never believe it when people tell you this younger generation does not measure up to the last. It all depends on what you learn from your life experience beyond the classroom, and what you do with it. So let go of what is lost, live life gloriously and fruitfully and spend time with the people you love. 38.     Thank you.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/opening-remarks-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-varsity-voices-dialogue-18-june-2022,

The rise is largely driven by increased spread of newer Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5.More Community Cases with BA.5 Subvariant Detected2. Although the BA.2 subvariant still accounts for the bulk of our COVID-19 infections, the proportion of BA.4 and BA.5 infections is rising. About 30% of the COVID-19 cases in the community in the past week were cases with BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, as compared to 17%, 8% and 3% for the previous three weeks respectively. BA.5 alone is estimated to contribute to 25% of all cases this week. The surge in BA.4 and BA.5 cases is likely to continue, driven by their higher transmissibility compared to BA.2.3. Currently international and local evidence shows that the severity of BA.4 and BA.5 infections is similar to that of earlier Omicron strains. The current Safe Management Measures (SMMs), including the requirement to wear masks while indoors and Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs for some higher-risk activities, will remain.4. The Ministry of Health (MOH) will continue genomic surveillance for circulating subvariants in Singapore, including requiring some infected individuals to take an additional government-funded polymerase chain reaction swab for genomic sequencing.Hospital Capacity Remains Tight 5. While we have not seen a significant increase of severe COVID-19 cases in our hospitals, and the number of cases in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) remain low, our public hospitals remain busy caring for non-COVID patients, and many hospitals experience high bed occupancies.6. To ensure that precious emergency department (ED) resources are available to patients who need urgent emergency care, we strongly advise the public to only seek medical treatment at a hospital’s ED for serious or life-threatening emergencies. Patients with minor ailments are strongly urged to seek medical attention at General Practitioner clinics.Vaccination and Boosters are an Important Line of Defence7. Vaccinations are critical to protect us against severe illness when infected with COVID-19, especially given the uptick in cases. In this regard, we strongly recommend that seniors aged 80 years and above take their second booster shot. All other eligible persons should complete their primary vaccination series and get at least their first booster as soon as possible. MOH will soon be deploying mobile vaccination teams to help seniors get boosted.8. From 23 June 2022, five new Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) will begin vaccination and COVID-19 testing operations. Located in Ang Mo Kio, Bukit Merah, Sengkang, Woodlands and Yishun, the five new JTVCs will bring the total to 10 JTVCs across the island. These centres will offer the Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty and Moderna/ Spikevax vaccines. JTVC Bishan will offer the Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty and Novavax/ Nuvaxovid vaccines. Individuals aged 12 years and above may walk in to any of the JTVCs to receive their vaccination and booster.9. Please refer to Annex for the five new JTVCs. The full list of JTVCs can also be found at www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations/jtvc.10. As we step up more JTVCs and consolidate our resources and free up this space for other uses, we will be closing the Vaccination Centre (VC) at Raffles City Convention Centre on 18 July 2022. The VC will accept appointments made via the National Appointment System and walk-ins for vaccination until 18 July 2022.Keeping our Guard Up11. While our population is now more resilient against COVID-19, everyone must continue to play their part to continue to observe the SMMs, exercise individual and social responsibility, such as by self-testing especially when symptomatic, and avoiding social interactions if one has fever or respiratory symptoms, or tests positive for COVID-19. As persons with early COVID-19 symptoms may test negative on the Antigen Rapid Test (ART), they should consider repeating an ART test the next day if symptoms continue or worsen. This is because it takes time for a person’s viral load to reach the threshold for detection by the test kit.[Updated on 27 Jun]",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/rise-in-ba.4-and-ba.5-subvariant-cases-drives-recent-increase-in-covid-19-cases,

About 45% of the COVID-19 cases in the community in the past week were cases with BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants, up from 30% the week before. BA.5 alone is estimated to have contributed to 40% of all cases in the past week.  2.     However, international and local data show that the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants do not result in more severe outcomes as compared to the earlier Omicron strains. Coupled with our population’s high vaccination coverage, the number of severe COVID-19 infections has remained manageable. Our hospitals and COVID-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs) are prepared to cope with the projected surge in cases. We also have contingency plans to ramp up our healthcare capacity quickly, if needed.No Changes to Safe Management Measures (SMMs)3.     We will not be making changes to our SMMs at this juncture. Masking up while indoors will continue to be required, as a key line of defense. The current set of Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs for some higher-risk activities will remain unchanged. However, we are monitoring the situation closely, and do not rule out the need to tighten SMMs should the need arise.Practising Social Responsibility4.     Meanwhile, everyone should continue to exercise social responsibility and take additional precautions in the coming weeks to protect ourselves and our loved ones. This can be done by keeping masks on while indoors; avoiding in-person interactions if you feel unwell or display COVID-19 symptoms; regular testing using an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) especially when feeling unwell or before visiting vulnerable family members and friends, including family members in hospitals and residential care facilities; and placing greater emphasis on personal hygiene. Symptomatic persons may need to repeat the ART daily over a few days to rule out the possibility of false negatives in the early stages of an infection.Nationwide ART Kits Distribution5.     To support self-testing, MOH will be conducting a third national distribution of 10 ART kits to each residential household from 18 July 2022 onwards via SingPost. Due to the high volume of ART kits being distributed, we seek the public’s patience and understanding that it could take a few weeks for some households to receive the kits.6.     To support lower-income households who require more ART kits for self-testing beyond what MOH will be providing, beneficiaries of Social Service Offices (SSOs) and Family Service Centres (FSCs) may continue to request for additional ART kits at these locations. In addition, MOH will be working with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to provide ART kits on request to students from lower-income households. More information on the provision of these ART kits to be distributed by schools and educational institutions will be separately shared with students and parents.Strengthening Protection Through Vaccinations and Boosters 7.     The most important step to protect ourselves is taking our vaccinations and boosters. Three doses of mRNA vaccine (two primary series plus a booster) are needed to properly protect ourselves against the Omicron variant. Currently, there are still close to 70,000 eligible seniors aged 60 years and above who have not received their third shot or first booster. Family and friends of these seniors should encourage them to receive their booster doses without delay, so that they can stay protected against severe illness.8.     As for second boosters, not all individuals are recommended to take it. This is because after the first booster, the protection against severe illness remains very strong for most people, likely for a longer term. However, international studies show that some groups, even after the first booster, are at an increased risk of severe disease and will be most affected by waning vaccine efficacy over time.9.     The following groups of persons are therefore strongly recommended to receive a second COVID-19 booster around five months after their first booster:All persons aged 80 years and above;Persons living in aged care facilities; andMedically vulnerable persons aged 18 and above who are at higher risk of severe COVID-19, such as those with medical risk factors (as listed in Annex).  10.     For persons who do not fall into these groups, for now, there is no recommendation for them to receive a second booster. They continue to be well-protected against severe disease after their first booster dose. 11.     Nevertheless, we have been offering the second booster to all persons aged 50 to 79 years under the National Vaccination Programme, and will continue to do so. They can choose to take a second booster if they are concerned about their individual risk of severe COVID-19 as this is around the age where risk increases as chronic diseases start to set in. Such persons who live with elderly or medically vulnerable family members, or intend to travel overseas, should consider taking up the second booster.12.     All persons eligible for their primary series vaccination, first booster or second booster may receive their doses by walking into any of the 10 Joint Testing and Vaccination Centres (JTVCs) located across the island. The full list of JTVCs, their locations and opening hours can be found at www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations/jtvc. Residents may also book an appointment at the JTVCs/ participating Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs)/ polyclinics via their SMS invitation.13.     From 27 June 2022, Mobile Vaccination Teams (MVTs) have been deployed to selected heartland locations to make it even more convenient for our seniors to get vaccinated and boosted. The MVTs will be deployed at selected Residents’ Committee Centres at residential blocks and Community Centres. Each MVT will be deployed at a given site for two days before moving on to the next location.14.     MOH and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and the level of protection against COVID-19 in various segments of the population. We will make recommendations for the second booster in younger age groups when there is a need to do so. In the meantime, such persons are strongly encouraged to receive their primary series and first booster dose if they have not yet done so.Weathering the Next COVID-19 Wave15.     Singapore remains well positioned to be a COVID-19 resilient nation. We have sufficient resources and are well prepared to ride the impending rise in cases. While MOH continues to monitor the situation closely, living safely with COVID-19 is a collective effort. We urge everyone to take the necessary precautions, and remain socially responsible by observing the SMMs, conducting regular self-tests, and avoiding social interactions if one has fever or respiratory symptoms, or tests positive for COVID-19.    MINISTRY OF HEALTH  27 JUNE 2022 ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/preparing-for-rise-in-covid-19-cases-driven-by-the-ba.4-and-ba.5-subvariants,

I am delighted to join you today at the launch of the “Teens & Kin” exhibition presented by the Mind Science Centre at the Mind Art Experiential Lab (MAELab) at Alexandra Hospital. Building a Strong and Resilient Society 2.              The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the greatest challenges faced by our nation in recent years, and has impacted the mental well-being of many Singaporeans, including our youth. Regular polls conducted by the National Youth Council (NYC) between April and December 2020 on youths’ challenges and sentiments during COVID-19 found mental well-being to be a challenge for over half the youth population (52%) surveyed. The top stressors raised included anxiety over the future (53%), stress over finances (41%), and worries about academic or work performance (39%). Although youths have reported gradual improvements in their mental well-being with the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions in 20221, we can do more to support our youth. Each of us, in our roles as parents, mentors, family members, or friends, can be there to support one another and to build a more resilient society. The Importance of Youth Mental Health and Well-Being 3.              Growing up in a fast-paced urban society, Singaporean youth contend with a wide range of demands and challenges that can affect their mental well-being, especially through critical life transitions. For example, the teenage years can be a difficult time when young people struggle with issues of identity and belonging. Transition periods, such as enlisting for National Service, or getting one’s first full time job, can feel overwhelming. Young working adults may face stresses in managing their new life roles when they get married, or when they become a parent or caregiver. 4.              It is thus fitting that the “Teens & Kin” exhibition is launched in conjunction with Youth Day2, a day dedicated to celebrating the young people in our society and their contributions to Singapore’s development. Drawing from survey studies of Singapore youths and their relationships with family, the exhibition brings together thoughtful infographics, artwork commissions and activity areas. The exhibition seeks to share insights into adolescents’ mental health and well-being issues, and avenues for tackling these challenges. Notably, the exhibition features new artwork produced by Singaporean artist Mary Bernadette Lee and sixteen students from Boon Lay Garden Primary School, Hua Yi Secondary School, Yuan Ching Secondary School and Jurong Secondary School. The artwork reflects the mental health challenges affecting youth today, and the importance of family support in building resilience and inspiring hope and aspirations amongst adolescents. 5.              To help parents better support youths’ mental health needs, the Mind Science Centre (MSC) has introduced the Singapore Youth Resilience Scale (SYRESS), as well as the Mind and Parent booklet. These resources guide parents on the ten domains of resilience building that youths can tap on to cope with and overcome life stressors. The booklet also contains key scenarios and strategies that parents or caregivers can use in their daily interactions with their children, to instil positive coping methods. 6.              Apart from resources for parents and youth, the Mind Science Centre has also developed the Emotional Literacy & First Aid (ELFA) programme, a mental health training tool to equip individuals with basic mental health literacy and skills to support others in distress. The programme is available to the healthcare community, and will be extended to volunteers and community partners later this year. I would like to commend the Mind Science Centre for developing these resources, and hope that that the resources will be useful to parents, youth, and Singaporeans. Developing a Whole-of-Society Approach to Tackle Mental Health and Well-Being Efforts 7.              We recognise that many youths are keen to contribute to mental health awareness and peer support initiatives. As such, the Youth Mental Well-being Network was launched in 2020 to mobilise youth volunteers to develop initiatives to improve youth mental health. To date, the Network has brought together over 1,500 individuals and initiated more than 20 ground-up initiatives. At the same time, we recognise that mental health issues affect everyone in society, both young and old. Moving forward, the Network will be expanded to achieve a wider impact and benefit the larger population. 8.              It takes a whole-of-society approach to promote the mental health and well-being of the population. In this regard, the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health & Wellbeing, which was set up last July to oversee and coordinate cross-cutting national mental health issues, comprise members from the public, private and people sectors. The Taskforce has conducted a review of existing mental health efforts and developed preliminary recommendations to enhance the mental health of Singaporeans. The Taskforce is currently embarking on a public consultation exercise to seek the public’s views on the recommendations. As mental health concerns all of us, we welcome your feedback on the Taskforce’s preliminary recommendations through this exercise, which will continue until 7 August. You can do so via the REACH public consultations webpage. Closing 9.              Mental health is an integral component of overall health and well-being. At the exhibition, 18 volunteers from all walks of life will be bringing visitors on an insightful experiential journey through the themed sections. I hope that a walk through the exhibition will inspire all of us to take concrete steps towards resilience and mental wellness, and to support one another to foster greater mental well-being and resilience in our society. 10.           Thank you.[1] NYC’s Youth Sentiment Polls (Jan 2022 to Apr 2022) – 51% of respondents reported good or very good mental well-being in April 2022.[2] Singapore’s Youth Day 2022 is on 3 July 2022 (Sunday).",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-dr-janil-puthucheary-senior-minister-of-state-ministry-of-health-at-launch-of-the-mind-art-experiential-lab-(maelab)-curation-on-teens-kin-on-1-jul-2022,

We anticipated this wave when we learnt about the subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, which have a significant growth advantage over BA.2. This wave however, arrived slightly earlier than the July - August timeframe that we expected. That is why we have maintained the indoor masking requirement even when cases were low and stable, in order to moderate the infection rate when this new wave arrives. High vaccination coverage that we have will also tamp the size of the wave. To reduce the infection rate further, all of us can play our part, stay at home when we do not feel well, test ourselves regularly, especially if we are meeting people who are vulnerable or attending big meetings or events, such as before coming to Parliament. And if we still want to reduce the infection rate even further, more stringent Safe Management Measures (SMMs) will need to be implemented. That means re-introducing things like group sizes, capacity limits, masking outdoors. As Minister for Health, I can never say we will rule out these steps if we are hit with a serious infection wave, but as far as possible, we should avoid them, especially if we are reasonably confident that our hospital capacity can hold up, and that we are determined to live with COVID-19 and continue our journey of endemicity. For this current wave, our assessment is that it will not be as severe as the Omicron wave we experienced earlier this year. This is because many more of us have gained stronger immunity either through booster shots or recovery from infections. And this will significantly impede the circulation and transmission of the BA.4 and BA.5 viruses. In South Africa, the second Omicron wave driven by these two subvariants was approximately a third of the peak of the previous Omicron wave. But every country’s experience will be different and unique. But we have good reason to believe that this will be a smaller wave than the last. Today is Tuesday. Tuesday is always the day where cases spike up. We should expect at the end of today, case numbers of over 12,000. This is a tad higher than the same time last week, which was over 11,000, 10% more than last week. So there are indications that we are near the peak, if not, at the peak. We should be relieved that the number did not double from last week, otherwise we would be at 24,000, or 22,000 this week.The key is to ensure that hospital capacity is not overly stressed. And here, we have been relying on two strategies. First, ensure high vaccination and booster coverage so that as many people as possible are protected from severe illnesses if they are infected. Second, ensure that our healthcare institutions and facilities are prepared and able to ramp up, should there be increased admissions. These strategies continue to be relevant for this current wave. Let me talk about the first point, in response to Mr Ang Wei Neng’s and Mr Yip Hon Weng’s questions. The most important is for everyone who is eligible to take their first booster shot or their third shot (first booster, third shot). After several mutations, we now need three shots of vaccines to properly protect ourselves against the Omicron variant. The vaccines were developed in the early days - the wild type of the Alpha and the Beta only two shots were needed. With more mutations, we now need three shots. There are about 60,000 seniors aged 60 and above who have not taken their first booster or third shot. This number has come down from last week, when DPM Wong and I announced that there were 70,000 and it has now come down to 60,000.  So they are coming forward, which is a good thing but we urge all of our seniors who have not taken your booster shot, your third shot, to do so quickly. Because it makes a huge difference as to whether you will fall severely sick if infected. We have also recommended since March that vulnerable individuals should take a second booster, or a fourth shot. This includes all persons aged 80 and above, those living in aged care facilities, or those with underlying illnesses, and are vulnerable. In recent months, we have stepped up our efforts to remind seniors to do so. We made regular announcements and have been progressively sending out SMS notifications, reminders, to eligible individuals. They can walk into any Joint Testing and Vaccination Centre, participating Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) or Polyclinics to receive their second booster dose. Alternatively, individuals can also book an appointment using your notification SMS. Since 27 June this year, we have also been sending out our mobile vaccination teams (MVTs) to our heartlands to make it even more convenient for our seniors to get vaccinated and boosted. We will cover a total of 60 sites. Last week, we planned for 50. We are going to increase it. Now it will cover 60 sites. Staff and volunteers from our partners, People’s Association (PA) and Silver Generation Office (SGO), they are also reaching out to our seniors through house visits, through engagement dialogues and to address many of the queries that our seniors may have. Many members of this House have been reaching out and talking to seniors and engaging them. Thank you very much for doing so. Persons who are recommended to receive the second booster under prevailing recommendations should proceed to do so, even if you have contracted COVID-19 previously. Ideally, an individual should wait 90 days after infection to take your second booster. It will help the booster shot work better. So wait 90 days to take your booster. But if you are in a hurry for whatever reasons, we will offer the second booster at least 28 days after your infection. So please, tell your residents, if you have been infected it does not mean that you are exempted from the booster. All of us respond differently. Some of us have hardly any response. So to be safe, take your booster shot.The second prong of our strategy is to augment and optimise our healthcare capacity. While current international and local evidence show that severity of the Omicron subvariants are not worse compared to that of the earlier Omicron strains, our hospitals, GPs and other healthcare institutions are on standby to bolster their capacity to prepare for future waves. Our hospitals remain ready to ramp up dedicated ICU and isolation bed capacity should there be an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who require hospitalisation. Actually, they are, and they are already doing so, and they are now very busy. We have also maintained sufficient beds in our COVID-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs) to manage serious cases but do not need hospital care. We have recently consolidated our CTFs from about 2,000 over beds to 1,300 beds but with higher manning ratio, and this will make it easier to transfer patients from acute hospitals to the CTFs without a significant drop in level of care. They are now about 25% occupied. Our GPs continue to take care of COVID-19 cases within the community, and Nursing Homes are equipped to manage lower risk cases within their facilities. To help reduce risk of developing severe disease and hospitalisation, COVID-19 therapeutics such as the oral antivirals (e.g. Paxlovid) are made more readily available in primary care and Nursing Home settings as early treatment, and pre-exposure prophylaxis is available in hospital outpatient settings for at risk populations. As at 30 June, all polyclinics and 103 participating PHPCs can prescribe oral antivirals to clinically eligible patients in the community. With these measures, the vast majority of cases are managed outside of hospitals, which is appropriate, given the high level of vaccination in our population.However, our public hospitals continue to face high demand from non-COVID-19 patients, what we call business-as-usual (BAU) patients. Over time, we hope more of our CTFs can be multi-purpose isolation and treatment facilities, for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. We have already reconfigured one of our CTFs at Sengkang Community Hospital into this new model and we will explore converting other CTFs. Finally, Ms He Ting Ru asked about healthcare subsidies related to COVID-19 pandemic. As at end FY2021, the Government has spent about $730 million and $220 million on subsidising inpatient and outpatient treatments for COVID-19 respectively.Since February 2020, we have progressively stood up more than 1,000 PHPCs. Alongside our polyclinics, the PHPCs play critical roles in providing government-subsidised swabs, COVID-19 vaccinations, and oral antivirals. We did not reduce the number of PHPCs earlier because we anticipated a new wave of infection, which did happen. And we are in the middle of this new wave now and it will be inappropriate to stand down PHPCs at this juncture. This is in response to Ms He’s question. So in conclusion, Singapore has been weathering the COVID-19 pandemic through a comprehensive approach. While we have assessed that there is no need to tighten SMMs for now, we urge everyone, play our part to take the necessary precautions, and exercise individual and social responsibility to keep the infection rates low, support our healthcare workers and healthcare institutions to weather through this wave.[1] This refers to PQ 1887: To ask the Minister for Health since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (a) how much has been spent on subsidizing COVID-19 patients for (i) in-patient treatments and (ii) outpatient treatments; and (b) whether there are plans to cut down on the number of Public Health Preparedness Clinics. [2] This refers to PQ 1847: To ask the Minister for Health (a) whether personal reminders will be sent to those eligible for their second COVID-19 booster shot; and (b) for those who have contracted COVID-19 recently, what is the advisory with regard to them getting their second booster shot.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/omicron-vaccinations-and-healthcare-capacity,

More importantly, having gone through and still going through a gruelling pandemic, today is a good occasion to pay tribute to the outstanding performance and dedication of our nurses.The COVID-19 Journey for NursesYear 2020 – Managed migrant worker dormitories, ramped up isolation and ICU beds, and set up Community Care Facilities3.     It has been a trying two and half years.4.     It started in 2020, when COVID-19 was still an unknown virus and came to our shores. Soon, it forced us to shut our borders and curtailed personal freedoms. The operating posture in hospitals changed overnight. All of you stepped up, caring for large numbers of patients while donning full Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Many of you stayed at designated accommodations to minimise exposure to the community and protect your loved ones.5.     A bigger crisis hit when the disease broke out in several foreign worker dormitories. But our healthcare workers did not back down in the face of adversity. You rose to the occasion. In the migrant worker dormitories, you set up health posts and healthcare processes. You administered swab tests and implemented infection control protocols to curb the virus spread.6.     As the community cases surged, nurses were an integral part of our effort in ramping up isolation and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in hospitals, and setting up Community Care Facilities (CCFs) to care for COVID-19 patients with milder symptoms. You are the ones who kept these critical facilities running.Year 2021 – Supporting National Vaccination Programme, riding through the Delta wave7.     The first turning point of the pandemic occurred in 2021, when vaccines became available and we started our National Vaccination Programme. You helped run the vaccination centres, administer vaccines to millions of people, put at ease those who were nervous about taking the jabs, and took care of those who felt unwell after the injections.8.     Today, over 93% of our total population is fully vaccinated, and 78% and counting have received their first boosters. Singapore has recorded one of the highest vaccine coverage rates in the world. It makes a huge difference in preventing infected individuals from developing severe complications from COVID-19 infections.9.     Then the Delta wave struck towards the end of 2021. This is a particularly nasty variant, as many individuals, especially the elderly and sick, were admitted to the ICU. This affected regular hospital operations very significantly as it diverted resources from non-COVID-19 patients who also needed care. Once again, you stepped up, stretching yourselves in caring for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. Non-ICU nurses had to take up ICU duties. You cared for and witnessed numerous severe cases, including many who unfortunately passed on with you by their side.2022 – The Omicron Wave10.     When the Delta wave subsided in end 2021, it was a relief, but the respite was short-lived. Soon, we heard of a highly-mutated, more transmissible new variant from Africa – called Omicron. We delayed its arrival through border restrictions and domestic social restrictions, but by February 2022, we were confronted with a massive Omicron infection wave.11.     Fortunately, the symptoms of Omicron infections were less severe compared to Delta. The burden of care then shifted from the ICU to the Emergency Department (ED) and normal wards. Once again, nurses took on the high surge in patient load. While we could discharge many patients every day, more patients would arrive the next day. Every week, we hoped the situation would ease, but it went on and on, from one week to the next, and lasted for about 12 weeks.12.     To ensure hospitals could still cope, we intensified the medical care provided at previous CCFs and converted them to COVID-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs) and expanded their capacity. Again, nurses stepped up to operate and provide support at these facilities. In fact, nurses from all over Singapore – from both public and private institutions, from acute and community hospitals, from specialty centres, and even from the Health Promotion Board – all came together to run the much-needed CTFs.13.     Our nursing students played a key role too. We were desperate for nursing manpower, and so worked with Nanyang Polytechnic (NYP) and Ngee Ann Polytechnic to mobilise our nursing students. The Polytechnics brought forward the 10-week final hospital posting from December to November, for about 1,200 nursing students. The Singapore Institute of Technology also facilitated the extension of clinical placements from two weeks to four weeks, for 190 nursing students who are already Registered Nurses. And just earlier this year in March, about 300 nurses undergoing advanced training at NYP returned to the hospital frontlines for two weeks.14.     Most of our nursing students are young. But they knew what was at stake and took on their assignments with gusto, including sacrificing vacation breaks. They had an early induction on what being a nurse is about. Their spirit and dedication bode well for the future of the profession.15.     We are now in the middle of another wave. As I have always said, going through a wave is like riding a bicycle downslope. If you do not do anything – you will accelerate faster and faster, until you crash. So, we always have three things with us to control this bike going downslope – left brake, right brake and cushion at the end. The left brake is Safe Management Measures (SMMs) to reduce transmission and infections. The right brake is vaccinations, so that it also reduces transmission and more importantly, if you are infected, you are less likely to fall severely ill. But that will still make the bike go down at quite a high speed. When you go down and hit the road, you have the cushion, which is our healthcare capacity. You are the last line of defence when all else fails. When patients appear before you, you take care of them.16.     What is happening in this current wave is that the left brake – SMMs – there are almost none. The only thing that we have implemented is wearing masks indoors. This is such an important juncture in our journey towards endemicity, because it is the first time since the pandemic that we are going through a wave without a circuit breaker, without heightened alert, not even with group sizes of five, and no capacity limits – none of that. We are trying our best to avoid doing that, because that is an important mark of living with COVID-19.17.     Our right brake – vaccinations. We are still vaccinating, but our coverage is already very high. So on the left, we try not to do; on the right, there is only so much we can do. What is left is the cushion at the end, which is our healthcare capacity. In other words, in this Omicron wave, by and large, the burden falls on you, on our hospitals, on our nurses, on our medical personnel.18.     As the rest of Singapore goes through a wave like this, and people go about our lives normally, I hope you all remember who is carrying the burden. Who is carrying the burden to make sure that the rest of Singapore, businesses, students, people who enjoy themselves – recreation, sports – everything goes on, because our hospitals are working and our nurses and doctors are working flat-out.19.     I believe there are good reasons, looking at the numbers, that the trajectory of the wave has almost peaked or is at its peak. I really hope from here, things will get better.The Nobility of Nursing20.     I just gave a broad sketch of what you have gone through over the past two and a half years. Today, the pandemic is not over, but thanks to vaccines and a good healthcare system run by good people, we are much more resilient to the COVID-19 virus and are making good progress to live with COVID-19.21.     It is with deep gratitude that I thank you for what you have contributed, in our nation’s journey towards endemicity. The prolonged battle has been unprecedented for our healthcare system, but nurses stood the test, with many going beyond your normal call of duty. And your contribution is deeply appreciated.22.     Let us pause on the word “contribution” for a while, to talk about what that encompasses. Indeed, an important part of healthcare is the practical knowledge, science, diagnosis, treatment, care procedures, and day-to-day running of hospitals. Many of these are easily observable and even quantifiable, in terms of number of infections, beds occupied, patients attended to, tests conducted, vaccinations administered, etc.23.     But nurses also bring something else that may not be so easily discernible, much less measured. Yet it is essential and irreplaceable – and that is human compassion. Not everyone can be a shoulder to cry on when a loved one is in distress or lost. Not everyone can bring peace to a patient or loved one in times of anxiety. Not everyone can make a patient smile even at his lowest moments, or look into the future with optimism as he regains his strength.24.     In a crisis as isolating as COVID-19, the human compassion of nurses is empowering, comforting and invaluable.25.     Back in 2005, when I was the Chief Executive of the then-Singapore Workforce Development Agency, we started a mid-career skills conversion programme for nurses. It started with not many applicants, but gradually it gathered momentum. I saw many people who wanted to join nursing for various reasons – from practical considerations like it is an industry that needs manpower, or following the footsteps of a parent or sibling, to having experienced the need to care for a loved one. These experiences can leave an indelible memory of what it is like for someone and their family to journey through care and treatment.26.     I asked the senior nurses at the Ministry of Health what motivated them and their colleagues to take up this profession. They told me that everyone at some point in life will need care, and even more so in the last moments of our lives. It is here that they, and perhaps some of you, found your calling: being there in the last moments of another person’s life, helping them fill the last pages with meaning, helping them make sense and make peace with their life’s journey.27.     Indeed, it is a huge sense of purpose and fulfilment to be there for others in their most difficult moments. And in our country’s hour of need, when we are besieged with the debilitating virus, and uncertainty about the future, your never-say-die attitude is uplifting, and an inspiration to the whole nation. This goes beyond human compassion, and represents the spirit and essence of our people and nation.A Tribute to All28.     As I come to the end of my speech, I want to pay all nurses a tribute – you are the backbone of our healthcare system. Without you, our system cannot stand. Thank you for choosing to do what you do, for serving selflessly, for all the work you put in – the work we see, but especially what we do not see.29.     Congratulations to all our awardees this afternoon, and I wish everyone a Happy Nurses’ Day!",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-minister-for-health-mr-ong-ye-kung-at-nurses'-merit-award-6-july-2022,

It is my pleasure to join you at the official opening of HCA Hospice Limited’s (HCA) third day hospice here at the Outram Community Hospital. 2. Since the 1980s, palliative care has made great progress and expanded into different settings – such as the inpatient, home, and day care settings – to cater to the needs of patients. Services are accessible to all, with the majority of patients paying affordable rates after subsidises.3. HCA is one such valuable provider of palliative care. Every year, HCA serves more than 3,000 patients across its hospice services. It is the largest community palliative care provider in Singapore, offering comfort and care in the home and day care settings to its clients at no charge. It has continued to thrive in these extraordinary times brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. I would like to take this opportunity to thank HCA’s patron, Mr Lim Boon Heng, for his unwavering support to HCA throughout the years. 4. Indeed, despite the ongoing pandemic, I am heartened to see HCA continuing to achieve excellence and show your utmost care and concern for the community. HCA staff achieved the Healthcare Humanity Awards and Community Care Excellence Awards in 2020. You demonstrated resilience and resourcefulness during the pandemic, with a dedicated COVID-19 taskforce, a robust pandemic response plan and a 24/7 COVID-At-Risk clinical team. 5. I must also thank HCA for your adaptability and understanding. This official opening ceremony had to be rescheduled from January earlier this year to today due to the tightening of restrictions during the Omicron wave. I thank you for your understanding.  OASIS@OUTRAM6. Today, we are here to witness the official opening ceremony of Oasis@Outram. Established with a gift of $2.47 million by the Lien Foundation, Oasis@Outram will join the ranks of HCA Kang Le Day Hospice and HCA Day Hospice @ Serangoon, to be HCA’s third day hospice. These three centres offer more than 60% of day hospice capacity in Singapore, enabling patients to remain cared for in the community. Oasis@Outram will add capacity to this effort by serving up to 48 palliative patients at its maximum capacity. 7. Notably, Oasis@Outram is located in the new Outram Community Hospital, which also provides inpatient palliative services. This co-location enables both the HCA and Outram Community Hospital teams to forge closer partnerships and provide a more seamless continuum of care for palliative care patients transiting from the hospital to home. It also provides a state-of-the-art sanctuary for its patients and respite for their loved ones, where their needs and interests are met individually. 8. Instead of a pre-decided programme, patients in Oasis@Outram can choose from a range of activities, such as art and craft sessions, or take part in singing and music therapy. HCA also displays creativity in caring for its patients. Last Christmas, HCA transformed Oasis@Outram into a “Christmas Wonderland”. It featured a “gifts auction”, dancing, and even served cocktails and mocktails to their patients. Such activities bring some much-needed joy to patients.9. Besides serving seniors, Oasis@Outram uniquely serves young patients with life-limiting conditions from the Star PALS (Paediatric Advanced Life Support) programme. It provides dedicated facilities and safe spaces for our young patients and their caregivers. There is even a cozy play corner and a mechanical hoist to carry the children, relieving their caregivers from the physical strain. 10. Knowing that their loved ones are well taken care of is especially critical since the impact of life-limiting illnesses on palliative care patients often weighs heavily on their caregivers, who grapple with grief and caregiving responsibilities. Oasis@Outram also provides caregiver respite. Caregivers are invited to join in the activities, use the facilities, or even help as a volunteer. This allows them to spend quality time with their loved ones. 11. Recently, at the Work Plan Seminar for the community care sector, I spoke about the importance of palliative care. It is an area where we will try to push and bring forward to the top of our agenda in the Ministry of Health. A few things have become very important, other than COVID-19. COVID-19 will always occupy us in the present and coming months. But if we look far enough, five to 10 years on, Healthier SG is important to keep people of working age healthy. To complement it, we need a big push on palliative care. 12. We do not have to further explain why it is needed. Most people at an advanced age towards that phase of their lives prefer to go comfortably and surrounded by loved ones. That is the wish of most people, but too few are fulfilling their wish. We need to recognise that we want palliative care to be more accepted. I believe it is more accepted today. We started palliative day hospice in 1993 when the first centre was set up, and the second centre in 1995. We have five centres now – the remaining three centres were only set up in the last three years. This shows that people are responding to it, and the community care sector is also responding to this demand. 13. We must recognise two things. First, to make palliative more receptive and available to people, it is not just about hospitals but also about the community, such as having facilities which provide day care services. Second, it is not just about the patient, but also about their caregivers who sometimes suffer in a different way but just as much as the patient. We need such facilities and community support to provide them assurance, care and comfort. Step by step, we will make more progress.14. In closing, I would like to thank all the donors, volunteers, staff, and supporters of HCA, for bringing Oasis@Outram to fruition. Improving end-of-life care is one of MOH’s priorities over the next few years. We aim to strengthen end-of-life care, to help people maintain quality of life even in their final days, and leave well. This will help our loved ones fulfil their last wishes. 15. To do so, we need to raise awareness of end-of-life care and pre-planning, make more timely referrals to palliative care, smoothen hospital discharges, and improve caregiver support. Day hospices, like Oasis@Outram, play an essential role in this effort. It is our vision that all individuals will be able to access and receive appropriate quality end-of-life care, which allows them to spend their last days in a comforting environment of their choice, surrounded by their loved ones. 16. I am happy to declare Oasis@Outram officially open.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-official-opening-of-oasis@outram-day-hospice-13-july-2022-10.00am-11.30am,
