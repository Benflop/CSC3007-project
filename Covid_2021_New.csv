SGP,Asia,Singapore,22/1/2021,59250,15,27.286,29,0,0,10864.383,2.75,5.003,Tightening Safe Management Measures and Update On Vaccination Plans,"1.      It has been nearly a month since we transitioned to Phase Three of our re-opening.  We anticipated then that there could a greater level of transmission due to the increased interactions in the community, and that we would need to continually adjust and calibrate our measures depending on the infection situation. Indeed over the past week, we have seen an increase in the number of local cases, some of which are currently unlinked and have resulted in the formation of community clusters. This is a real cause for concern as it could indicate that there is wider, as yet undetected, community transmission. We must remain vigilant to avoid an uncontrolled resurgence of community cases.  Tightening Safe Management Measures 2.      In light of the latest situation, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has decided that we will need to calibrate the pace and scale at which certain activities in the community can resume. a. Hence we had earlier announced the suspension of the pilot to allow shortlisted nightclubs and karaoke outlets to resume operations. b. We will also postpone the start of the National School Games which was originally scheduled in February. The Ministry of Education (MOE) will review again the type of sports to resume and in what format, to ensure that games can be conducted meaningfully but safely for our students. More details will be provided by MOE later. 3.      To further mitigate the risk of large community clusters arising from infections that spread within a household and through them to all their contacts, we will impose a cap of 8 distinct visitors per household per day. This will take effect from 26 January 2021. Individuals should also limit themselves to visiting at most two other households a day, as much as possible. 4.      The maximum group size for social gatherings outside the house will remain at 8 people for now. That said, everyone should keep their social circle small instead of mixing with multiple social groups. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and impose further measures as necessary. Staying Vigilant During the Festive Season 5.      There will be increased transmission risks in the community during the upcoming Chinese New Year period.  So it is important that everyone cooperates with the new measures.  6.      In particular those who are dining out should make sure they wear a mask if they are not eating or drinking. We already do not allow singing (including by diners) and other live performances at F&B establishments and work-related events where food is served. Diners should also avoid raising their voices, at all times. This also means that face masks must be worn during the tossing of yusheng, and that the lohei should be done without any verbalisation of the usual auspicious phrases. F&B establishments and enterprises serving lohei must ensure that both the staff and patrons comply with these requirements. 7.      We encourage everyone to connect digitally with their family and friends instead of going on physical visits.  For those who would like to do house visits, they should limit their visits to family members and to not more than 2 other households a day. Singaporeans are also reminded that the prevailing rules at F&B establishments will apply to reunion dinners held within them. In other words, there must not be any multiple table bookings. The only exception is for those from the same household. But even in such instances, there should not be any inter-mingling across tables.  8.      We will step up enforcement checks at F&B establishments, malls and other crowded public spaces during this period. Strict enforcement actions will be taken against individuals and operators who do not comply with safe management measure. The penalties include fines and prosecution in court, depending on the severity of the offence.  For operators who do not comply with the measures, their operations will be suspended.  9.      With everyone’s cooperation, we can avoid sparking large clusters which may then necessitate further tightening of measures or even a reversion to Phase Two or Phase One measures.Surveillance Testing  10.      As community interactions are likely to increase in the leadup to Chinese New Year, we will carry out surveillance testing for stallholders, shop owners, persons in the food and beverage industry, as well as food delivery persons operating in and around Chinatown. While there has been no evidence that these community groups are at higher risk of infection, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be offering tests to them as they are expected to interact more frequently with other members of the public during this time. The testing will take place from 8 February to 9 February 2021. MOH, together with other government agencies, will be progressively reaching out to these identified community groups with further details.11.      We strongly encourage all individuals in the identified community groups to come forward for testing. The costs of these tests will be fully borne by the Government. Extension of COVID-19 Testing Subsidies 12.      Besides active case finding and ongoing surveillance testing, the Government has been conducting Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) of workers in the various sectors that have higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 or with larger negative impact if they were to have a COVID-19 infection in their midst. These include workers living in dormitories, and those working in the construction, marine and process, aviation and maritime sectors, among others. 13.      The Government had earlier announced that it will bear the costs of RRT in these sectors until 31 March 2021. As COVID-19 continues to pose significant public health risks in these sectors, the Government will continue to bear the costs for COVID-19 RRT until 30 September 2021 to support their safe operations. 14.     The Government will continue to review its subsidies for COVID-19 RRT to ensure that they support our public health efforts while sharing the costs equitably between taxpayers, employers and individuals.Update on Vaccination Plans15.      Vaccination is critical to protect us and our loved ones against COVID-19. Vaccination also protects those in our community who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons. This collective protection will become more effective as more people are vaccinated and is a key enabler allowing us to return to normalcy.   16.      We have made good progress in our vaccination programme. As of today, more than 60,000 individuals have received their first dose of the vaccine, including staff working in healthcare, nursing home, frontline and essential services, as well as seniors in our nursing homes. 39 staff at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) have also received their second dose of the vaccine, and completed the full vaccination regimen, and in 2 weeks’ time, they will have built up maximum protection against COVID-19. These numbers are expected to rise substantially in the coming weeks as we continue to ramp up our vaccination operations safely. 17.      While there will be some upcoming delays to the shipments of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines due to Pfizer’s manufacturing plant upgrading, we will continue to monitor our supplies closely to ensure that we will have enough vaccines for all Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore by the third quarter of 2021.Vaccinating Our Seniors 18.      This week, residents in our nursing homes have started to receive their vaccinations. Our seniors in the community will also be able to receive their vaccines very soon. 19.      From 27 January 2021, we will commence vaccination for seniors, starting with pilots in Ang Mo Kio and Tanjong Pagar, where larger numbers of our seniors reside.  The aim of these pilots is to enable us to iron out all the operational processes before scaling up nationwide. Vaccinations will be progressively extended to seniors across the island from mid-February 2021.  More vaccination centres will be set up over the next few weeks to ensure that all seniors can conveniently receive their vaccinations at a centre near to where they live. The vaccination centres will be located in high population catchment areas and/or along public transport routes for greater accessibility. We seek everyone’s patience and support as we progressively roll-out the vaccinations to all. 20.      All seniors will receive personalised letters inviting them to make an appointment for their vaccinations. They will be able to make appointments online, or they can also visit selected Community Centres near them to book an appointment in-person. 21.      In addition, community volunteers from the People’s Association, as well as our Silver Generation Ambassadors will be conducting house visits and tapping on existing grassroots events, to answer queries and help our seniors to book an appointment if necessary. Seniors will also be provided with information sheets with more details on the COVID-19 vaccine and the vaccination process. Should our seniors require further assistance, they may also call the MOH hotline at 1800-333-9999. Keeping Safe During Phase Three22.      Tightened safe management measures, supported by widespread surveillance testing and progressive vaccination of our population starting from those in settings with higher public health risk will help us to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and keep community transmission rates low. This is key if we are to remain in Phase Three and consider any further re-opening.  23.      We seek the cooperation of all Singaporeans to remain united and disciplined in the fight against COVID-19. Observe all safe management measures, see a doctor and get tested when sick, and be vaccinated when it is offered to you. Together, we can look forward to a safer and healthier 2021. Annex: General Rules and Guidelines for a Safer Phase Three",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/tightening-safe-management-measures-and-update-on-vaccination-plans,

The Moderna COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated a high vaccine efficacy of 94%, and its safety profile is consistent with the standards set for other registered vaccines used in the immunisation against other diseases. 4.       We endorse HSA’s recommendation of the suitability of use in individuals aged 18 years and above in Singapore. However, pregnant women, severely immuno-compromised persons and those under the age of 18 should not receive the vaccine yet, until more safety and efficacy data become available. Persons with a history of anaphylaxis or severe allergies should also not be given the vaccine at this time. 5.      The Expert Committee will continue to monitor and review the use of COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore as more data becomes available over time. While Singapore currently has a low rate of local transmission of COVID-19, we remain at risk of a surge in cases. Therefore it is important that we achieve as comprehensive a coverage of COVID-19 vaccination as possible across the entire population. We strongly encourage all persons who are medically eligible to be vaccinated when the vaccine is made available to them.EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION 3 FEBRUARY 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/expert-committee-on-covid-19-vaccination-endorses-use-of-moderna-covid-19-vaccine,

AnswerLess than 1% of our total arrivals since 1 April 2020 tested positive for COVID-19. Most of the arrivals during this period were from Malaysia, Mainland China, Indonesia and India. The proportion of imported cases out of the arrivals from each of these countries and regions was 0.04%, 0.01%, 1.6% and 3.7% respectively. From 1 January 2021 onwards, all Work Permit and S Pass holders are required to have medical insurance to pay for COVID-19 medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore should the pass holder develop symptoms or test positive within the first 14 days of arrival into Singapore. As employers of Work Permit and S Pass holders are responsible for their medical treatment in Singapore, this requirement helps protect employers against medical expenses. From 1 February 2021 onwards, all short-term visitors applying to enter Singapore under the Air Travel Pass and Reciprocal Green Lanes have to purchase travel insurance for their COVID-19-related medical treatment and hospitalisation costs in Singapore. The travel insurance will help them pay for the costs of their medical treatment in Singapore. The visitors can purchase the travel insurance from Singapore-based or overseas insurers. The Government will review whether to extend the insurance requirement to other travellers, taking into consideration the COVID-19 situation in their country of origin as well as the availability of products in the insurance market.     ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/percentage-of-confirmed-covid-19-cases-for-each-country-and-travel-insurance,

Question No. 657 To ask the Minister for Health in light of the Ministry's reply of 6 January 2020 on multi-pronged interventions to support seniors (a) how effective have these initiatives been in reducing elderly suicide; and (b) how is the Ministry working towards improving existing initiatives to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our socially isolated elderly. Question No. 658 To ask the Minister for Health (a) in light of a 2016 report on how 47,000 seniors aged 65 and above live by themselves, whether that figure has changed and, if so, by how much; and (b) in light of survey results showing lower social satisfaction levels for senior citizens during the circuit breaker period, whether the Ministry plans to enhance existing support mechanisms for the isolated elderly in the next two to three years. Answer There were 400 reported cases of suicide in 2019, of which 122 cases involved persons 60 years and above.  The number of attempted suicide cases was about 1,000 in 2019.  We do not have the breakdown of number of suicides or attempted suicides by those who live alone or have depression. We also do not have the breakdown of attempted suicides by age.  The number of Singapore residents aged 65 years and above who live alone has increased from 47,000 in 2016 to 67,600 in 2019, representing 9.7% and 11.6% of our resident population aged 65 years and above respectively.   The causes of suicide are complex and multi-faceted, often involving family, social and mental health issues.  Therefore, the government works closely with Ministry of Social and Family Development and community partners on multi-pronged approaches, comprising promoting mental health and well-being, raising awareness on suicide prevention, and providing professional support and crisis interventions to at-risk groups, including targeted support for older adults. First, in upstream intervention, we seek to build public awareness on the importance of good mental well-being.  For example, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) conducts training sessions on mental well-being and change management for the general population, to help them recognise the signs and symptoms of poor mental health.  Under the Seniors’ Health Curriculum programme, HPB also conducts a series of healthy ageing workshops, which include psychosocial education modules, to equip seniors with knowledge and skills to self-care and manage mental well-being, including where to seek help if necessary. Secondly, we have services and programmes to provide support to older adults with social and emotional needs.  For example, staff and volunteers from the Silver Generation Office (SGO), local grassroots organisations, social service agencies and senior activity centres proactively and regularly reach out to seniors living alone or who are at risk of social isolation, to provide companionship and encourage them to participate in social activities.  From May 2021, we will be rolling out a new eldercare centre service model.  Under this new model, eldercare centres will serve as key touchpoints to all seniors, regardless of their housing type, income or frailty levels, and will reach out to seniors to proactively engage them.  Seniors can also sign up with CareLine, which is a 24/7 social support hotline that provides tele-befriending services as well as emergency response to seniors in distress. Third, we also have targeted support for seniors who may be at higher risk of suicide and their family.  Under the Community Resource, Engagement and Support Teams (CREST) programme, Community Outreach Teams reach out to at-risk elderly and their caregivers to provide basic social-emotional support and education on coping with mental health needs, and link them and their caregivers to community resources for further support.   Family Service Centres also provide case management and counselling support to low-income and vulnerable individuals and families, including seniors, to help them with issues such as family, financial and emotional difficulties. Lastly, there are services in place to support crisis intervention.  For instance, the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) operates a 24-hour hotline to counsel persons in distress. Similarly, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) operates a 24-hour Mental Health Helpline to assess and triage cases, and activate home visit teams if necessary.  For cases of attempted suicide, the Police may engage the next-of-kin to link them up with support or refer the individual to IMH for assessment and treatment. These services continued to operate throughout the pandemic, including during the Circuit Breaker period, to ensure that seniors at risk of social isolation remain supported.  Befriending engagements were conducted remotely where feasible in place of physical home visits. SGO also engaged about 21,000 seniors who have little or no social support during the Circuit Breaker period through weekly or fortnightly calls to monitor their well-being.  Community mental health services also remained accessible with safe management measures in place for persons, including seniors, with mental health needs.  The Government also set up the National CARE Hotline to offer an additional avenue of emotional and psychological support to public who are facing distress due to the pandemic. I  wish to record my thanks to the officers and volunteers of all these services who reached out to all these persons in need during the difficult times through the Circuit Breaker. We will continue to improve our inter-agency and multi-pronged efforts to support seniors in the community, especially those at-risk of suicide.    ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/elderly-suicide-and-social-isolation-during-covid-19,

Several weeks ago, we also faced an increase in unlinked and community cases in Singapore. Hence, even within Phase Three, we had tightened community safe management measures and recalibrated the pace and scale at which activities were able to resume. While the outbreaks in several countries have abated in recent weeks, we need to remain vigilant. We will continue to find ways to allow our economy and our society to further re-open in a safe way. But given the dynamic situation here and around the world, we will need to adjust our safe management measures from time to time. We do not expect to move out of Phase Three any time soon.The vaccines approved in Singapore have been shown to be effective in providing protection against the COVID-19 virus. We are awaiting more evidence about how effective they will be about preventing transmission. We are also closely monitoring their effectiveness against new viral variants. Meanwhile, our best strategy is to continue to be disciplined about safe management measures, and achieve a high level of vaccination within our population to boost our collective immunity.Singapore has made good progress on our vaccination programme. We are continuing to bring in more vaccine supplies, and we encourage all eligible Singaporeans to get vaccinated, to protect themselves and others around them.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/easing-out-of-phase-3,

Mr Yip Hon Weng and Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about the COVID-19 situation. Let me provide a brief overview.2. Globally, the number of new cases and deaths continue to trend down, although there was a spike in the last week of February so we need to watch this. Within Singapore, the COVID-19 situation has stabilised, with 1 or 2 new community cases on some days. Imported cases are isolated on arrival and the risk of transmission to the community is low. However, the World Health Organization has just warned that we need to stay vigilant as the pandemic is not likely to be over within this year.3. I want to thank everyone - Singaporeans, healthcare workers, businesses, enterprises, government agencies - for playing your part this past year. Your sacrifices have helped Singapore weather this storm.4. Mr Ang Wei Neng asked about the impact of COVID-19 on our infrastructure projects. As I informed the house earlier, the pandemic has delayed many of our healthcare infrastructure projects by up to a year or so. Construction works have since been ramping up progressively and we are working on contingency measures to ensure we are able to meet the needs of our people.5. We are making steady progress in our vaccination programme. As of 4 March, more than 350,000 Singapore Residents have received their first dose, including some 80% of our healthcare workforce, and 215,000 have received their second doses.6. We have started with our seniors too. I would like to thank our community volunteers from the People’s Association and Silver Generation Ambassadors who have worked hard in reaching out to our seniors and helping them to make their appointments. Over 40,000 seniors aged 70 and above have received their first dose. We will soon begin the vaccination of seniors aged 60 and above.7. Mr Chairman, allow me to say a few words in Mandarin please.8. 年长者若感染冠状病毒就可能会引发严重的病症。因此，年长者将优先接种疫苗。获准在新加坡使用的疫苗都符合严格的安全和效益标准。所以我呼吁国人放心积极接种疫苗。9. 一些患有慢性病的国人担心是否能够接种疫苗。不必担心，因为我们会安排医护人员在场评估您是否能够安全接种疫苗。其实大多数都能安全接种疫苗, 包括那些患有糖尿病，高血压， 高胆固醇，气喘，慢性肺病， 心脏病， 及在癌症复原中的患者。因此我鼓励患有这些疾病的国人在受邀后尽快登记接种疫苗。10. Let me emphasise that only COVID-19 vaccines that meet strict standards of safety and effectiveness will be used in Singapore for our Singapore residents.11. We will monitor the development of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our measures accordingly. We will also continue to strengthen our defences for future health system crises, such as Disease X. SMS Janil will share more.STRENGTHENING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM FOR THE LONG-TERM – OVERALL UPDATE ON THE THREE BEYONDS12. Even as we mobilise the nation to fight COVID-19, we have to remain focused on several long-term issues. 13. Members may recall our Three Beyonds to meet our challenges in the future. Beyond Hospital to Community, to provide better care closer to home; Beyond Quality to Value, to help Singaporeans stretch their dollar; and Beyond Healthcare to Health, to help Singaporeans stay healthy.14. We will continue to anchor care in the community by strengthening primary care. We will be building 12 new polyclinics, bringing the total to 32 by 2030. The Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) has been expanded recently to allow more Singaporeans to receive subsidised care from private GPs, who are our key partners in primary care.15. We are also expanding community care, especially for our seniors. We have expanded the Community Nursing teams to cover 29 regions across Singapore since September 2020, with a total of 185 Community Nursing Posts to make care more accessible to our seniors. We will add new Community Nursing Posts where needed.16. Our second thrust is to stretch your health dollar. Dr Lim Wee Kiak and Mr Leong Mun Wai asked about how we manage healthcare costs. We keep care affordable and sustainable through a multipronged approach. 17. First, we leverage risk pooling. Insurance plays a useful role in helping us stretch our resources through pooling, so that those who are ill can tap into the pool to pay for the healthcare services they need. That’s why we introduced MediShield Life. But insurance has an inherent risk of over-consumption. This is because of “OPM syndrome”. What is “OPM”? Other people’s money because through insurance, we are pooling resources and we are tapping on other people’s money in the pool to pay for our healthcare services. So we need safeguards, to encourage prudence when deciding on healthcare services.18. Dr Tan Yia Swam asked about Integrated Shield Plans (IPs). I agree with Dr Tan that we can all benefit from more information-sharing and a better understanding of insurance products. Towards this objective, the Ministry of Health has facilitated several engagement sessions with insurance providers and professional bodies to foster a better understanding of the parties’ concerns.19. Dr Tan was present at these sessions and we benefited significantly from her contributions. We have resolved some issues, not all, but discussions are still ongoing. An important progress we have achieved is the establishment of a multilateral platform comprising Life Insurance Association, Academy of Medicine, Singapore, and Singapore Medical Association. This platform will allow discussions to resolve issues of common concern.20. We are also setting up a claims management mechanism to facilitate resolution of claims related matters. Our common objective is to ensure patient care is not compromised and allow patients adequate choice, while ensuring that fees and claims remain reasonable. I am confident that with this common understanding, we can find workable solutions that will benefit all parties, insurers, doctors, as well as patients.21. Ms Hazel Poa asked whether IPs can be made fully portable. As IPs are commercial products, their features and pricing are ultimately determined by private insurers. But what is important is that all Singaporeans are covered under MediShield Life, regardless of their medical conditions.22. Second, we will continue to improve the healthcare system’s cost effectiveness and efficiency. As Minister Lawrence Wong mentioned, the Agency for Care Effectiveness has enabled us to save $300 million since 2016, and benefitted over 375,000 patients. The Agency for Logistics Procurement and Supply (ALPS) has also achieved cost savings of about $180 million in two years by driving economies of scale through group procurement.23. Even with our best efforts, we will still be spending more on healthcare over time given an ageing population and increasing consumption of healthcare services. The government continues to bear a significant and growing share of the National Health Expenditure, from 40% in 2013 to 46% in 2018.24. We want all Singaporeans to be healthy and have access to good and affordable care. We pay particular attention to lower income households as Mr Leon Perera highlighted, and provide them with additional support to ensure healthcare, including preventive health, remains affordable for them and that they can improve their health outcomes.25. Health outcomes are influenced by multiple factors, including social, biological, cultural preferences and environmental factors, in addition to social economic status (SES).26. Local studies showed that adults with lower SES do have differences in chronic diseases prevalence. We have been publishing health data regularly. More data has been collected in the last two years, including breakdown by education as a proxy for SES and the data will be published later this year. We will continue to refine the data we publish. From local studies, we also know that adults with lower SES do have good access to care and are able to control their health conditions well. Again, using educational attainment as a proxy for SES, among persons diagnosed with diabetes, hypertension, and high blood cholesterol, over 90% of those with below secondary school education had visited their doctor for their condition at least once in the preceding year. Further, the proportions of those with acceptable control of their medical conditions are close to the national averages. Nonetheless, we must continue to support them to improve health outcomes, and we will need to start from young, which I will talk about in a short while.27. Through enhancing our healthcare financing system over the years, we have kept healthcare affordable, especially for the lower income patients.28. In fact, the lowest income quintile’s share of total subsidies was 37% in 2018, the highest across all income quintiles. Our healthcare financing framework is a progressive one, overall. Further, the amount of subsidies received per household for the lowest income quintile has increased by over 70% from 2013 to 2018.29. Overall, government spending on healthcare has grown year after year and is likely to continue to increase. But as Dr Tan Yia Swan mentioned, government subsidy is a finite thing. That is why we have to be prudent in how we allocate limited resources, to ensure that the support we provide is more targeted to benefit those with greater need.30. This is our third effort – to better target subsidies, such that those with less will receive more, healthcare is kept affordable for all, and patients can be cared for at the most appropriate facilities.31. We have recently enhanced the subsidies for low income patients at the public Specialist Outpatient Clinics (SOCs).  We will further adjust subsidies at the SOCs by introducing two new tiers of 30% and 40% subsidy for higher income patients. This will enable more subsidies to be channelled to those in greater need.32. With more targeted subsidies at the SOCs, we can now allow private patients discharged from our acute hospitals to choose subsidised follow-up care at the SOCs. Currently, they are treated as private patients at the SOCs.33. Next, we will align the means-testing basis in the acute hospitals to per capita household income which is more reflective of patients’ means, similar to the basis used for most healthcare schemes, rather than rely on the personal income of the patient today.34. Lastly, we will also enhance subsidies at community hospitals, to keep them more affordable and facilitate the flow of patients from acute hospitals.35. Taken together, these moves will ensure more targeted use of our healthcare resources, stretch our healthcare dollars, and encourage appropriate care. Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon will go into greater detail in his speech.36. In the longer term, the best way to manage healthcare costs is through our third thrust - staying healthy. We encourage all Singaporeans, young and old, to partner with us on this journey: attend your recommended health screenings regularly, go for vaccination, and adopt healthy living habits.37. I encourage all to also continue the good fight to win our ongoing War on Diabetes, and keep chronic conditions at bay. Parliament Secretary Rahayu will share more on this, as well as our other health promotion efforts.TRANSFORMING AND MAINTAINING A FUTURE-READY HEALTHCARE SECTOR38. Earlier I talked about the 3 key thrusts, better care, stretching your dollar, and staying healthy. These are not isolated initiatives. All our policy and measures work together to take care of the health of every Singaporean, starting from birth and throughout their life journey, keeping them as healthy as possible, for as long as possible.39. The best place to start is right at the beginning. Minister Masagos will share our thinking on improving child and maternal health, how to better support our children and their families, and to bring agencies together to co-deliver services and solutions for better outcomes.40. Our care transformation journey will continue. As we plan for our future health system, we will study how we can develop a longitudinal system of care services and programmes, to journey with you and design programmes with a life-course approach, taking care of each Singaporean from birth and throughout their life. The National Healthcare Group has in fact developed a River of Life framework to test this approach.41. As staying well often involves not just health but also social and other factors, we will also explore how we can pull in resources across agencies and service providers to support your overall well-being. SingHealth, for example, has started trials to prescribe not just drugs but also social programmes, such as diet, exercise, and social activities. Dr Tan Wu Meng would be glad to know that they too have care coordinators42. Finally, the built environment also plays a key role in nudging our choices. Therefore, the built environment should be designed to promote healthy living and digital tools can also be used. The National University Health System is working on this with the various agencies. We will share more on these efforts at a later stage.43. Anchoring all these transformation efforts are our healthcare staff who will continue to play a central role in our future health system, much like how they have been at the frontline in our battle against COVID-19. We are blessed with a very dedicated, driven, and professional team. They are our most precious resource, and we will continue to provide them with better progression, more training opportunities, and greater recognition of the work and risks they undertake. Senior Minister of State Koh Poh Koon will elaborate on this.Conclusion44. To conclude, it has been - as PM Lee said - a year of uncertainty, anxiety and fear. Many of us would have emerged slightly different from how we first entered. A little more tired, more stretched, perhaps a little tougher and I hope a little wiser.45. Partner with us as we journey forward and as we transform our healthcare system to be future-ready. Let us work together, and help all Singaporeans to stay healthy, and live well, every day of your life. Thank you. ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-gan-kim-yong-minister-for-health-at-the-ministry-of-health-committee-of-supply-debate-2021-on-friday-5-march-2021,

As of 7 March 2021, we have administered more than 596,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. In total, about 379,000 individuals in Singapore have received at least the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, of whom more than 217,000 have received their second dose, and completed the full vaccination regimen. Bringing forward the offering of vaccination for seniors2.      Vaccination for seniors aged 70 years and above commenced island-wide on 22 February 2021. More than 55,000 seniors have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and another 96,000 seniors have made appointments to receive their first dose in the next few weeks. Invitation letters have already been sent to all seniors aged 70 years and above, and we are making steady progress in vaccinating this group.  3.      The Ministry of Health (MOH) had earlier announced that seniors aged 60 to 69 years will commence vaccination from around end-March. As more vaccine supplies have arrived, we are able to bring forward the vaccination for seniors aged 60 to 69 years.  All seniors in this age group will receive their invitation letters within the next few days. Each letter will have a weblink which can be used to register for vaccination, after which an SMS with a unique booking link will be sent to the senior’s mobile phone for them to book a vaccination appointment. Alternatively, seniors can also book their appointments for vaccination at any community centre/club island-wide. Vaccination for essential frontline workers of critical importance to Singapore and other higher risk groups 4.       The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination, which was tasked by MOH to make recommendations to the government on Singapore’s COVID-19 vaccination strategy, had earlier called for the prioritisation of healthcare workers, nursing home staff and residents, as well as those involved in COVID-19 operations. The Expert Committee had also recommended to prioritise frontline workers who are at higher risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection, including those working in the aviation and maritime sectors, as well as specific groups who are of critical importance to the functioning of Singapore. This would ensure that Singapore would be able to continue to function effectively amidst a local outbreak situation.5.        We will thus continue to extend our vaccination programme progressively to other higher risk groups, as well as essential frontline workers of critical importance to Singapore, including those who could pose risks to our vulnerable populations and the community at large if they are infected. Essential personnel in critical functions6.      MOH, together with relevant government agencies and statutory boards, have been progressively offering vaccination to personnel who provide essential services. These include security agencies responsible for safeguarding our borders and law and order (including ICA officers who man our border controls); those involved in the provision of utilities such as water, energy and telecommunications services; and workers who ensure the supply of essential food and household items. 7.        As more vaccine stocks arrive, we will extend vaccination to essential personnel involved in other critical functions, such as postmen and delivery staff, as well as news reporters, and bank operation staff engaged in critical banking and financial systems operations. Essential workers with higher risk of exposure and onward transmission8.         Vaccination was earlier offered to groups who are at higher risk of exposure, such as active taxi and private hire car drivers who might convey individuals seeking medical care who turn out to be COVID-19 patients. 9.         Going forward, we will extend vaccination to those who have multiple touch points with many members of our community. These include those who work in hawker centres and markets, such as stallholders and stall assistants, as well as those who serve in the food delivery industry. 10.     We will also begin vaccination for the educators and staff who come into prolonged contact with children and youth. We will start with those working in pre-schools, national schools, ITEs and polytechnics, and will progressively extend to those working in other education institutions. As the current vaccines are not yet certified for those below the age of 16 years1, the vaccination for educators and adult staff will help to protect them and their students, and ensure that our schools and education institutions remain safe places for learning. 11.       Eligible individuals will be informed of the vaccination schedule by the relevant government agencies and will receive a personalised SMS from MOH notifying them to book their vaccination appointments at vaccine.gov.sg. COVID-19 vaccination will be available at all vaccination centres, all polyclinics and selected Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs).Migrant workers living in dormitories12.      Migrant workers living in dormitories are another group where large COVID-19 clusters could rapidly develop and grow, with a high risk of transmission to the local community. Vaccination of migrant workers living in dormitories is thus part of our national COVID-19 vaccination strategy to protect all Singaporeans and long-term residents. 13.      COVID-19 vaccination for migrant workers will start with 10,000 workers who have never been infected by COVID-19 and are living in the five largest dormitories. Vaccination for migrant workers will be conducted in-situ at these five dormitories.  14.        Vaccination will then be progressively made available to other migrant workers. Workers who have completed vaccination can be subjected to a lower frequency of testing, with testing occurring every 28 days instead of the current 14-day cycle. Cargo vehicle drivers and accompanying personnel delivering essential goods into Singapore regularly15.      To minimise transmission risks from workers who engage in the supply of essential goods to Singapore, we will offer vaccination later this month to selected cargo drivers and accompanying personnel who enter Singapore from Malaysia on a regular basis. Vaccination will provide an additional layer of protection against COVID-19, ensuring that these personnel can continue to deliver essential goods to Singapore safely.  Those who are eligible for vaccination will be notified via a personalised SMS from the Ministry of Trade and Industry and will be contacted subsequently for an appointment to undergo vaccination at designated sites in Singapore. Those who are not vaccinated may continue to enter, subject to the prevailing infection control measures such as on-arrival testing and corresponding safe management measures.Provisions have been made to vaccinate everyone in Singapore16.        We will continue to systematically extend the vaccination to other segments from April onwards. All Singaporeans and long-term residents in Singapore will have the chance to be vaccinated.  17.        While COVID-19 vaccination is voluntary, we strongly encourage Singaporeans and long-term residents who are medically eligible to come forward for vaccination when their turn comes. That is the only way we as a society can keep each other safe from the disease.MINISTRY OF HEALTH8 MARCH 20211  The Health Sciences Authority has approved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine in individuals aged 16 years and above, and the use of the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine for individuals aged 18 years and above, under the Pandemic Special Access Route.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/covid-19-vaccination-brought-forward-for-all-seniors-extended-to-essential-services-personnel-and-higher-risk-groups,

It is my pleasure to join you today to celebrate the launch of Singapore’s first ever geragogy guidelines by the Council for Third Age (C3A).Embracing Longevity through Active Ageing and Lifelong Learning2.      In 2015, the Action Plan for Successful Ageing was launched by the Ministerial Committee for Ageing to help Singaporeans lead active lives, age confidently, and build strong bonds with family and community. When we were developing the Action Plan, we gathered ideas from Singaporeans on what successful ageing means to them. Seniors shared with us that they wanted to continue learning during their golden years, not only for work but also for learning’s sake to keep their minds active. Many seniors also told us that they did not have the chance to have a proper education when they were younger, and so now that they have time and are able to, they would like to go back to school.3. The Ministry of Health (MOH) therefore worked with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and C3A to launch the National Silver Academy (NSA) in 2016. The NSA is a network of post-secondary education institutions and community-based organisations that offer subsidised learning opportunities for seniors. The NSA now has a network of some 46 course providers offering more than 1,000 courses each year, on a wide range of topics such as gerontology, the arts, health and wellness, as well as IT. To date, more than 60,000 learning places have been taken up.Charting the Way Forward for Senior Learning and Teaching 4.      Over five years have passed since the Action Plan for Successful Ageing was first launched, and MOH is embarking on a refresh of the Action Plan, to ensure that our blueprint for ageing planning continues to be relevant to the needs of today’s and tomorrow’s seniors. Lifelong learning will continue to be a key focal area going forward, as we seek to empower seniors to continue contributing their knowledge and expertise, and support them in staying connected to the community.5.      Over the past year, C3A has done much to ensure that seniors can continue to pursue learning safely despite the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, C3A launched the e-Nuggets Series, which consists of weekly talks hosted live on Facebook earlier last year in a bid to keep seniors physically and mentally engaged when most of them stayed at home. These virtual talks provide light-hearted and bite-sized e-learning for seniors and received over 100,000 views cumulatively last year. C3A is also working with partners in rolling out new modalities of online courses to support tech-savvy seniors who wish to leverage digital platforms to learn on-the-go.6.     Beyond improving access, C3A has also been working to enhance seniors’ learning experience. For example, C3A regularly reviews the NSA course offerings to ensure that our seniors have a wide variety of interesting and affordable courses to choose from. With the launch of the new gerogogy guidelines, C3A has taken another important step towards enriching the learning experience for seniors.7.      As Mr Kwok has shared earlier, the geragogy guidelines focus on three areas: i) to help trainers understand the learning preferences of senior learners; ii) to guide trainers in adopting effective training methods; and iii) to provide insights on trainers’ characteristics that are preferred by seniors. With these guidelines, trainers can adapt their delivery format, and communication and teaching style to create a more enriching and fruitful learning experience for our seniors.8.     I would like to thank C3A for taking the lead in working with various partners to develop these guidelines. I would also like to take this opportunity to encourage training partners and providers in senior learning to adopt the geragogy guidelines in your curriculum planning and course design. With more learning opportunities tailored to their needs, seniors will be encouraged to participate and enjoy the benefits of learning to age well.Closing9. In our journey to promote senior learning, we hope to foster a more conducive learning environment and to make learning inclusive for all senior learners, so that they can lead active and meaningful silver years. I hope C3A will continue to keep up the good work in promoting active ageing in Singapore and helping our seniors stay socially and mentally engaged.

It has been more than a year since the first case of COVID-19 came to Singapore and was reported in Singapore and despite the uncertainty and little knowledge we had of the disease in those initial days, our healthcare workers, our frontliners, our entire healthcare system – public and private –  have remained steadfast in their roles, vigilant for the cause that they have to protect us against, and duty bound in their mission. They persevered and surmounted many challenges that they have faced. 2.              They have made sacrifices. They have gone beyond the call of duty, and most importantly, they have come together as we have as Singaporeans, as one people, as one healthcare system to serve wherever help was needed. Doctors, nurses, allied health professionals, pharmacists, and operations and ground staff, caring for COVID-19 patients, walking the ground and keeping ourservices running, not just delivering COVID-19 services and looking after the coughs, the colds and broken bones, the children and the elderly.The administrative and ancillary services and teams helping to organise and very importantly pivot our healthcare infrastructure and operations to meet rapidly changing needs, scaling services’ capbability and functionality rapidly in an agile manner.Laboratories are working around the clock to ramp-up testing capacity. Clinical research and epidemiological teams, gathering information to combat the spread and contain the virus.Logistics, IT and procurement teams working together to keep our healthcare supply chains resourced and our system running smoothly.3.           There are just some of the efforts that have contributed to Singapore’s overall COVID-19 response. 4.             Within the National Healthcare Group (NHG), no effort has been spared to protect Singapore, and your staff from COVID-19, which supported us by redeploying manpower and resources to Community Care Facilities and medical posts in purpose-built dormitories, in COVID-19 swabbing and testing operations, and now, with the greatest vaccination roll out in our history.5.              The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) has been at the forefront of Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. It’s integration of clinical, research and public health functions allowed it to respond swiftly and effectively to outbreaks in a proactive and coordinated manner, in learning the lessons each time to better prepare us for the next pandemic. NCID has also been important in advising MOH, as well as sharing knowledge externally, for example with the World Health Organization, representing our views on a global stage.6.               But no single healthcare worker, no single organisation, no single institution or healthcare cluster can manage this on its own. This pandemic, COVID-19, this crisis has required strong collaboration across the healthcare family to ensure that Singapore is prepared and that patients receive the appropriate level of care that we hope to get. It is this strong sense of commitment and purpose from our healthcare professionals that has helped to keep Singapore safe, and I would like to express my deepest appreciation to every member of the healthcare community.7.             Our fight has been a whole-of-society effort, and has gone beyond our hospital walls. It is part of our community, and support from every Singaporean and every Singaporean institution is crucial. Non-governmental organisations such as HealthServe, social service organisations and volunteers chipped in to ensure the well-being of our migrant workforce. Singaporeans have rallied together for the greater good, adapting to new social norms and adhering to safe management measures. We have so far been able to contain the spread of the virus as one Singapore, and this collective effort will stand us in good stead as we plan to tackle the challenges ahead and keep our COVID-19 situation stable.8.             Today, 18 artists from the Singapore Art Society have come together to produce a painting to pay tribute to our healthcare workers and frontliners, titled “Heroes of Our Time”. Even the way that they have produced it, coming together in smaller groups, distributing their efforts so that they can maintain their safe distancing measures, keeping themselves safe, as they produce this work of art. That work of art conveyed our gratitude to the heroes among us to protect Singapore against COVID-19. I hope you will enjoy the art work we are going to unveil soon – I think we saw pieces of it in the video–and the art exhibition as much as I anticipate that I will.9.              As I walked in, I was struck. I haven’t been to this art exhibition yet but I saw some of the children’s work as I was walking in, and I think as you turn the corner and come into this lovely space, we do get an impression of the art. Seeing as I thought I was attending an event about COVID-19 and the pandemic, my first impression was, “My, what bright colours”. This is not an art exhibition of dark greys of doom and gloom. There are some silver moments that I noticed as I was sitting there, some reflections of what must have been difficult in trying times, but much of the artwork is bright and colourful, and built in to the seriousness, is a sense of hope and a sense of anticipation.10.             I think in a way that reflects where we are today in Singapore. We walk through Ion coming here. The shops are busy and there are lots of things happening. In the community, there is a sense of expectation, like a coil spring as we gear up our vaccination operations, and I hope the fact that we have been able to keep our healthcare systems going, the businesses as usual, how we have been able to keep our community organisations, voluntary welfare organisations doing the work that they do, how we have been able to produce art in the midst of a pandemic, are two lessons for us as we come out of this crisis in preparation for our future. Firstly, that we do have to be prepared and pay attention to these people who will work to keep us prepared, such as the heroes reflected in your art work, but also that we can do this. We can maintain a sense of unity, cohesion and hope, even in the most dire of crises. If we can hold on to those two ideas, that will prepare us well for the future and give us a sense of hope and aspiration that I think is reflected in many of the paintings here today. Thank you all very much, and congratulations.  ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-dr-janil-puthucheary-senior-minister-of-state-ministry-of-health-and-ministry-of-communications-and-information-at-the-heroes-of-our-time-commemorative-art-event-13-march-2021,

On 17 September, Foo had allegedly left home to go to Woodlands and Somerset area.15.          Foo is scheduled to be charged in court on 15 March 2021 for one count under Section 21A(1) of the Infectious Diseases Act and one count under Regulation 3(2) read with Regulation 3(3) of the Infectious Diseases (COVID-19 Stay Orders) Regulations 2020. Exercising social responsibility 16.       Any person convicted of an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act,  or Stay Orders Regulations is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or up to six months’ imprisonment, or both. 17.       We urge individuals to adhere to the prevailing measures, and to stay at home for the duration of MC issued for the episode of illness, to prevent putting our loved ones and others in the community at risk of infection. The Ministry of Health will not hesitate to take strict enforcement action against those who place the public at risk of COVID-19 infection by failing to comply with the Infectious Diseases Act,  or the Stay Orders Regulations.

As the link is unique to the individual, each link can only be used by the individual. Family members in the same household who wish to make appointments at the same vaccination site at a common timing may do so by booking their appointments online individually using their respective unique links, or by calling the Ministry of Health (MOH) COVID-19 hotline at 1800-333-9999 to make concurrent bookings, subject to the availability of appointment slots. We have been receiving many bookings for vaccination and we seek the public’s understanding that we may not always be able to arrange upon request for a couple to be vaccinated within the same time window, but we strive to accommodate as best as we can.Individuals receiving vaccinations are required to verify details such as their personal information and medical history before receiving the vaccination, to ensure that the vaccine is administered to the correct individual, and to those who are medically eligible. In the earlier phase of the vaccination programme, medical providers took a more cautious approach and verification happened at 4 junctures - (1) verifying against National Appointment System, (2) at registration, (3) right before vaccination, and (4) after 30 minutes of observation. This process has since been streamlined to twice: once at the registration and the second time before the individual is vaccinated.Members of the public can refer to a list of the medical considerations on who should not be vaccinated when they are registering for an appointment on the vaccine.gov.sg website. Medical conditions for which COVID-19 vaccination is not recommended include history of anaphylaxis, transplant within the past three months (solid organ or stem cell), and ongoing cancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy or radiation therapy. Persons with allergies may receive the COVID-19 vaccines, unless they have a history of any life-threatening allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis.

It is my pleasure to join you today at the Precision Public Health Asia Conference.2.      With advances in technology and research, we have a growing capability to use diagnostic tests which better identify individuals with a higher risk for developing chronic diseases and to stratify them based on their risk of developing complications. Our treatment capabilities have also expanded to allow greater precision in designing individualised treatrment plans, to optimise clinical outcomes. We need an overarching strategy to guide how this knowledge and use of new therapies can be appropriately utilised for our population. Public health policy has become the vehicle for us to develop these strategies and implement them in our delivery of healthcare services. Precision public health is an amalgamation of medicine, precision medicine and public health. To quote Muin J Khoury (Director, Office of Public Health Genomics, CDC, US), precision public health is about “bringing the right interventions at the right time, every time, to the right populations”.3.      Data plays a crucial role in harnessing the potential of precision public health. Data on population-level health indicators allows policy makers to formulate more targeted measures and campaigns to address the health needs of their citizenry. There are many programmes and initiatives implemented globally that utilise precision public health. They share in common the aim of improving population health, promoting a better quality of life, changing lifestyle practices, and potentially bringing about lower healthcare expenditure. I understand that conference delegates will be discussing various case studies over the next few days to better understand the potential of precision public health initiatives. This morning, I would like to share three examples of how precision public health is being applied in Singapore to benefit Singaporeans and residents.Application of PPH in Public Health Campaigns4.      Advances in precision public health capabilities have allowed the Ministry of Health here in Singapore to better utilise the increasing volume of data we have collected over the years. When formulating public health campaigns, Singapore leverages on technology and uses data to encourage Singaporeans to lead active and healthier lifestyles. For example, we have the National Steps ChallengeTM that aims to promote a healthier lifestyle among Singapore citizens and residents. It was first launched by the Health Promotion Board in 2015, it leverages behavioural insights and technology to motivate participants to improve and incorporate physical activity as part of their daily life. It also tailors rewards for sustained behavioural change when users reach different physical activity milestones.Application of PPH in Chronic Disease Management5.      A second application of precision public health is in chronic disease management. Digital biomarkers and other digital metrics can be collected in real time, combined with genomic data and traditional physiological and demographic information and collectively, these data then enable more accurate risk assessment and early interventions. An example is Familial Hypercholesterolaemia, an inherited condition that leads to higher rates of heart attack and vascular disease in affected people when they are young. his is one of several priority diseases that our National Precision Medicine Research strategy is targeting, as early identification and treatment of such individuals, and their affected family members, is cost-effective in preventing severe disease as well as decreasing morbidity and mortality.Application of PPH to tackle COVID-19 Pandemic6.      A third application of precision public health is in Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. In Singapore, precision public health has been applied in the use of precision technology and IT solutions across a continuum of measures taken to prevent and control the disease. Let me provide three further examples:a.  First, in preventing spread through importation, the use of wearable devices has allowed incoming travelers to serve their on-arrival quarantine outside of dedicated facilities, while maintaining a high degree of compliance. This has reduced the need for dedicated resources, and facilitated travelers self-isolating in their own homes, while simultaneously maintaining the public health imperative of having incoming travellers quarantined for the required period.b. Second, in the contact tracing of individuals possibly exposed to COVID-19, the use of applications such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether has provided definitive exposure history to investigation teams. This has facilitated the accurate and tailored public health assessment for quarantine of affected individuals, and outbreak management.c. Third, in epidemiological investigations, the use of whole-genome sequencing on COVID-19 positive cases has enhanced epidemiological investigation capability in determining transmission patterns and this has allowed the prompt roll-out of subsequent public health measures that are targeted to the situation at hand.Maintaining public trust with the use of PPH7.      While precision public health has immense benefits, the greater use of personal data and data analytics requires that we exercise greater responsibility and accountability in order to maintain public trust. In this regard, data privacy and cybersecurity are important governance issues that must be addressed. The Ministry of Health is developing a common set of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) policies and standards, known as the Health Technology Instruction Manual for public healthcare. This common policy set draws from the government’s own ICT management policies as a base, and can be adapted for use in different healthcare settings based on the needs of public healthcare providers. This allows for information technology to be used consistently in a manner which is both effective and secure.Closing 8.      Overall, the relevance of precision public health has never been greater. Today, we find ourselves in the midst of a global pandemic, confronted by a growing myriad of diseases and ailments that threaten to afflict populations, in developing and developed countries alike. The use of precision public health allows us to collaborate further across countries, specialties and disciplines – to share best practices, information and resources. This conference is one such opportunity for us to have more of these collaborative conversations.9.      To conclude, Singapore is honoured to host the Precision Public Health Asia Conference this year.

Those who registered more recently will accordingly receive their booking links early next month.For Singapore citizens and permanent residents who have more urgent needs, such as to travel overseas on compassionate grounds, or for employment or study purposes where working or studying remotely is not an option, they may make an appeal for earlier vaccination.We will consider such requests on a case-by-case basis, subject to the availability of vaccines.We thank everyone for their patience.We will continue to ensure that we provide a smooth and convenient Covid-19 vaccination experience as we work towards vaccinating all medically eligible Singapore residents by the end of the year.Dinesh Vasu DashGroup DirectorCrisis Strategy and Operations GroupMinistry of Health",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/covid-19-vaccination-invite-is-on-first-come-first-served-basis,

There are also third parties who have exploited the sharing of personal experiences by individuals, by reposting these personal accounts and making unsubstantiated claims about vaccine-related adverse reactions. They often continue to do so despite the original posts being removed or made private.2.            The Minister for Health has instructed the POFMA Office to issue Correction Directions on: (i) Facebook posts published on the Facebook pages of Goh Meng Seng (Satu Singapura) and Goh Meng Seng People’s Power Party on 2 April 2021 and 7 April 2021; and (ii) an article by Singapore Uncensored published on their website and their Facebook page on 7 April 2021. They will be required to carry a correction notice alongside their posts.Corrections and clarifications regarding falsehoods posted by Goh Meng Seng and Singapore Uncensored3.            There are false statements on COVID-19 vaccination contained in multiple Facebook posts and a website, namely:i.              Posts published on the Facebook pages of Goh Meng Seng (Satu Singapura) and Goh Meng Seng People’s Power Party on 2 April 2021, implying that COVID-19 vaccination had caused or substantially contributed to a stroke suffered by a doctor;ii.             Posts published on the Facebook pages of Goh Meng Seng (Satu Singapura) and Goh Meng Seng People’s Power Party on 7 April 2021, implying that COVID-19 vaccination had caused or substantially contributed to the death of an 81-year-old man; andiii.            An article published on the Singapore Uncensored website on 7 April 2021 (and subsequently shared on the Facebook page of Singapore Uncensored the same day) stating that an 81-year-old man had passed away from alleged vaccination complications.4.            These allegations are false. As of 14 April 2021, there is no credible evidence for an increased risk of heart attack or stroke with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines which are currently approved and offered in Singapore.5.            The medical team caring for the doctor has assessed that the doctor’s current condition is highly unlikely to be related to the COVID-19 vaccination, and Mount Elizabeth Hospital had issued a clarification on 4 April 2021.6.            The cause of death of the 81-year-old man was ischaemic heart disease (lack of blood circulation to the heart muscles). The Health Sciences Authority (HSA) Forensic Medicine Division has reported that based on the post-mortem, there was no evidence of acute anaphylaxis or an allergic reaction at the injection site of the COVID-19 vaccine. There was extensive narrowing of the three main blood vessels supplying blood to the muscles of the heart due to atherosclerosis (build up of plaques over time in the blood vessels that obstruct blood flow).7.            For facts of the case, please refer to the Factually article “Corrections and Clarifications Regarding Falsehoods on COVID-19 Vaccination” at https://www.gov.sg/article/factually150421  8.            COVID-19 vaccines that are used in Singapore have been assessed to be safe and efficacious by both the HSA and the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination. Medical teams are well-equipped and measures are in place at all vaccination sites to ensure the safety of vaccine recipients pre-, during, and post-vaccination. All vaccine-related incidents are taken seriously and healthcare professionals are required to report these incidents expediently to the MOH and HSA.9.            We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread unfounded rumors.

For the vast majority of those vaccinated, the COVID-19 vaccine is effective in preventing symptomatic disease. Nevertheless, a small number of vaccinated individuals may still develop disease, although such occurrences are currently assessed to be uncommon. Firstly, a vaccinated individual can still develop COVID-19 if they are exposed to a very large amount of the virus. Vaccination is an important tool to help lower the risk of infection and severe disease, but it does not eliminate the risk completely. This is why vaccination should be taken in tandem with existing public health and safe management measures such as mask-wearing and good personal hygiene, to reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19. Secondly, another concern about the reduced effectiveness of vaccines is the emergence of variants. The COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna used in Singapore currently have been shown to be effective against the original SARS-CoV-2 virus and some variants such as the B1.1.7 strain, although efficacy against other new strains may be lower. More data on this is being studied. While protection conferred against new strains may be lower, an unvaccinated person would have no protection against COVID-19 at all. Personal health factors can contribute to the risk of infection and severe disease from COVID-19, and persons with chronic diseases are at risk of more severe disease from COVID-19 infection. Vaccination has been shown in clinical trials to be equally efficacious in persons with chronic diseases, and it is recommended for them to be vaccinated. We strongly encourage all who are medically eligible to be vaccinated when the vaccine is offered to you, to keep our loved ones and those in the community safe. Vernon Lee (Associate Professor)Director, Communicable Diseases DivisionMinistry of Health",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/severe-infection-outcomes-can-be-prevented-for-those-who-receive-covid-19-vaccine,

Minister Lawrence Wong and I will address Oral Questions 1 to 19 and Written Questions 19 to 23 from yesterday’s Order Paper, questions 1 and 2 from today’s Order Paper, as well as the question filed by Mr Seah Kian Peng for a future sitting.2.            Sir, it has been 16 months since our fight against COVID-19 started. I last updated the house in January this year when we rolled out the national vaccination programme.Update on local situation3.            To date, we have confirmed a total of 61,378 cases of COVID-19 infections, and 31 of them have passed on.  The COVID-19 situation remains fluid.  Globally, we are seeing surges in daily new cases in several countries.  Locally, after half a year of low community cases, we have seen several clusters of infections over the last two weeks – a cluster involving an ICA officer and his family members, one at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, another at Tuas South Community Care Facility (CCF), a cluster at Pasir Panjang Terminal, and most recently, a cluster at our airport terminals.4.            We have also detected several unlinked cases, 10 in the last week. This suggests that there are unknown cases in our community that caused these infections, which is a cause for concern. Because for each unlinked case, there is an unknown source, and that is why it is called unlinked. For as long as we cannot identify the source, there is a risk that they may be spreading the infection.COVID-19 variants5.            New COVID-19 variants have also emerged that challenge our knowledge on the virulence and transmissibility of COVID-19.6.            To date, we have detected ten different COVID-19 variants among local and imported cases. A detailed breakdown was shared in MOH’s press release on 4 May.7.            Such variations in viral strains are not unexpected. It is in the nature of viruses to mutate. Therefore, we must expect to see new variants emerge from time to time.  However, some variants are of greater concern because of their increased transmissibility, severity of illness caused or ability to break through vaccines.8.            It is also not surprising to discover variant strains in Singapore. We cannot completely shut out our borders, close down the causeways, our seaport and airports because Singapore is not self-sufficient in many things and we need to maintain our supply lines and global connections to survive.  The virus will then find ways to infiltrate us.9.            Sequencing results indicate that the recent clusters at TTSH, ICA and Tuas South CCF were driven by the B.1.617.2 variant that was first detected in India. Three of the recent cases at our airport terminals also tested preliminarily positive for B.1.617.10.          While the definitive characteristics of this variant remain unknown, the large clusters and rapid transmission we see locally is concerning as it suggests that infections of this strain can spread quickly and widely. This is similar to the overseas situation where resurgence of cases are likely driven also by new variants.11.          The emergence of several clusters, new variants, as well as rising number of unlinked cases mean the risk of community transmission has gone up. Therefore, we must continue to stay vigilant and tighten our safe distancing measures in the community to slow down and prevent transmission of the virus, even as we make progress in our vaccination programme. We have also tightened our border measures to reduce the risk of importing cases.Update on Tan Tock Seng Hospital Cluster12.          Let me give a quick update on the cluster at TTSH. The first case of the TTSH cluster was confirmed on 28 April. It was a staff nurse who developed ARI symptoms that day. She dutifully reported her symptoms. She was immediately tested, and despite the fact that she had completed her vaccination earlier in the year, she was confirmed to be COVID positive. I should point out that this does not mean she had been the first infected case, and had brought COVID-19 into the wards. Investigation is still ongoing but her responsible act enabled us to pick up the cluster at TTSH.13.          Our immediate priority in such situations has been to contain and isolate the infections so that they do not spread to the larger community.  Hence, we immediately threw a containment ring around this first detected case, quarantining close contacts and testing everyone who could have been in contact with the individual. This included all staff and patients of the affected Ward 9D. By the next day on 29 April, we had identified three staff and six patients of Ward 9D who were infected.14.          One of these patients had started to display COVID-type pneumonia symptoms at this time too. As he had entered Ward 9D earlier on 20 April, testing and quarantine was hence further extended to all staff who worked in Ward 9D from 20 April, as well as discharged and current inpatients and visitors to Ward 9D from 20 April.  Testing was also expanded to include all inpatients and all staff working in the main ward block.15.          After this first round of testing was completed, all other TTSH staff were also screened. For additional precaution, patients and staff from the main ward block were also retested a second time. We then threw a larger ring around TTSH, inviting discharged patients and visitors who were in the hospital during the affected period to also be tested. They are not close contacts and hence have a lower risk of infection, but we offer to test them for abundance of caution and to give them peace of mind. For every case detected, a large ring was drawn around them for testing and isolation, and we lock down all wards that had exposure to the infectious cases.16.          In total, as of 10 May 2021, close to 2,500 individuals have been quarantined. 12,500 individuals have been tested as part of the special testing operations. This is in addition to 12,000 staff, 1,000 patients as well as those who had been quarantined. A total of 43 cases were confirmed, comprising 10 staff, 26 patients and 7 visitors or household members. We will continue to monitor the individuals who have been exposed, and retest them where necessary as some of them may be incubating the infection. 17.          Of the 43 COVID-19 cases in the TTSH cluster, 7 staff and 2 patients had received full doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. They were all either asymptomatic, or only exhibited mild symptoms, and none of them required oxygen support. Of the 34 individuals who were not fully vaccinated, six required oxygen, two are in intensive care and one has sadly passed away from COVID-19 complications.18.          While the numbers are too small to draw firm conclusions, the findings do indicate that vaccination provides critical protection even against COVID-19 variants.  We know that while vaccination does not eliminate the risks of infection totally, it does provide significant protection against infections and help to reduce the severity of the disease. Itis also likely to reduce onward transmission. I urge everyone to get vaccinated when it is offered to you, and continue to comply with safe management measures even if you have been vaccinated. This will help to keep all of us safe.19.          Tan Tock Seng Hospital has implemented a series of measures to prevent further spread within the hospital. Besides locking down the affected wards, TTSH has also stopped all new admissions to the hospital, restricted visitors, and reinforced infection control, hand hygiene, and PPE compliance for all staff.20.          Even while we were dealing with the cluster, work was also ongoing to understand the source and course of the outbreak. Investigation is still on-going and more will be shared when it is ready.21.          We have also learnt several important lessons:(a)          This particular B1.617.2 strain appears very infectious, and there will be other variants just like this;(b)          Without vaccination, the infection among healthcare workers would have been much worse;(c)           While vaccine breakthroughs are possible, vaccines can help to prevent severe illnesses;(d)          Vaccines can also reduce risk of further transmission, although the extent of which this is true is still being investigated;(e)          It is clear that vaccination is most effective when it is part of a whole suite of precautionary measures, such as mask wearing, safe-distancing, accurate testing, thorough contact tracing, and timely isolation.I will talk more about vaccines later.22.          Since the Tan Tock Seng Hospital cluster happened, there has been reports of healthcare workers there being shunned in public, or refused services.  I know this comes from a small minority of Singaporeans.  The great majority is thankful for the sacrifices and contributions of our healthcare workers, including those from Tan Tock Seng Hospital.  We know you have been working tirelessly in difficult and uncertain conditions. Despite the stressful situation caused by the outbreak, you continue to do your best to care for our patients.  I believe I speak for the great majority of Singaporeans, all of us in Ministry of Health, and everyone in this Chamber, that we are all solidly behind you.23.          Sir, while we are in the midst of what appears to be a re-emergence of cases in our community, we are in a stronger position today compared to a year ago. We know more about the virus.  We have strengthened our healthcare system, built community care facilities, expanded our testing capacity, enhanced our contact tracing capability, introduced safe distancing measures, and embarked on vaccinating our population, which I will touch on next.Vaccination plansVaccination progress24.          We started COVID-19 vaccinations in Singapore in end 2020 and we continue to make steady progress with our vaccination programme. As of 9 May, about 1.8 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine, and of which, about 1.2 million individuals have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen.25.          Take-up has been encouraging. About two-thirds of eligible persons aged 45 and above have received the COVID-19 vaccination or booked their vaccination appointments. However, we need to continue to encourage more to be vaccinated, especially among the seniors , given their age, they are the most vulnerable. I urge all of us to encourage our elderly family members too.26.          We will be inviting subsequent age bands to receive vaccinations from the later part of May. However, as vaccine supplies continue to be limited, vaccinations will be progressively extended in smaller age-bands. We thank everyone for your patience. If vaccine supplies arrive as scheduled, we will complete the vaccination programme by the end of this year.Efficacy of Vaccine - Implication of vaccine breakthroughs, re-infections, and variants on vaccination efficacy27.          Sir, I spoke about vaccine effectiveness earlier.28.          We knew from the start that vaccine breakthroughs are possible. But vaccination can still significantly reduce chances of infection. For example, based on a study published in Lancet, the Pfizer vaccine can reduce risk of asymptomatic infection by 91%. Vaccination also prevents severe reactions to the infections and is likely to reduce onward transmission.a.            Locally, as of 10 May 2021, 30 locally fully vaccinated cases tested positive for COVID-19. There were another 24 imported cases that were already vaccinated.b.            Most of our local cases of infected vaccinated individuals were asymptomatic. None had severe COVID-19 disease requiring more intensive care. This is consistent with the international experience and emerging evidence that vaccines are highly efficacious in protecting against severe COVID-19 disease and likely to reduce the risk of transmission.29.          There is also a question on re-infected cases, which is known to be possible from overseas and local experiences.  As of 10 May 2021, 26 cases have been assessed to be re-infections. We are still investigating whether these are due to general waning of immunity over time or lack of cross-protection against specific variants of COVID-19 that the individual is naïve to.  We will provide an update when we know more.30.          Overall, the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the known risks and we must continue to encourage Singaporeans to be vaccinated.31.          One area of concern is the emergence of new COVID-19 variants from time to time.  There is intense ongoing global scientific evaluation for these variants, which our experts are also participating in. The current global consensus is that the COVID-19 vaccines that have been approved can provide protection against these variants because these vaccines elicit a broad immune response involving a range of antibodies and cells. We will continue to monitor development in this area and assess whether our vaccine programme needs to be adjusted. Evaluation of vaccine for children below 16 years old, people with mild allergic reactions, need for booster shot32.          Members have also asked about vaccination for children below 16 years old, people with mild allergic reactions and the need for a third booster shot.33.          Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are currently only approved for use in persons aged 16, and 18 years old and above, respectively.a.            Initial data provided by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna at the time of the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) interim authorisation did not include data regarding their use in younger populations.b.            The Health Sciences Authority has been examining the supplemental data that have since been submitted for the Pfizer vaccine, to assess if the vaccine meets safety and efficacy requirements for authorisation under PSAR for use in adolescents aged 12 to 15 years. HSA will also do so for the Moderna vaccine when data is submitted to them. We will share more details when the studies are completed.c.             As for children below 12 years old, clinical trials are still ongoing and may take more time before enough data is available.34.          Mr Gerald Giam asked if patients who experience mild allergic reactions from the first dose can take their second dose. Persons who have been assessed by a doctor to be allergic to the first dose of COVID-19 vaccination are currently contraindicated from the vaccine and should not continue with the second dose.35.          We understand that individuals who cannot be vaccinated or cannot complete the vaccination may be concerned that they are not protected from COVID-19. These people are kept in our records, and we will inform them when there is a suitable vaccine for them, or new evidence that shows that current vaccines can be administered to them are available.  At the same time, as more of us are vaccinated, we also protect them indirectly.36.          As for booster shots, data on the need for it is still emerging, from both international and local studies.  We will share more when we know more.  Meanwhile, get the first two shots first.  37.          The HSA and the Expert Committee for COVID-19 Vaccinations will continue to monitor ongoing studies in areas such as the extent to which vaccines can prevent onward transmission, the durability of protection provided by vaccines, and the effectiveness of vaccines against emerging variants of concern and will provide updates when available.Adverse events, VIFAP 38.          Members have asked about adverse effects following vaccinations.39.          As of 18 April 2021, HSA has received 2,796 suspected adverse events reports associated with the use of COVID-19 vaccines. This represents 0.13% of doses administered but the majority are non-serious adverse events. Only 0.004% of our doses administered had reported serious adverse events.a.            In general, the observed trend of adverse events within Singapore is consistent with those reported overseas.b.            The most commonly reported adverse events are not serious. This includes dizziness, fever, muscle ache, pain at injection sites, headache and allergic reactions. These symptoms generally resolved within a few days.c.             Most of the patients here have recovered or are recovering from these adverse events.d.            We have also not seen any local cases of unusual blood clots associated with low platelets that have been reported with other vaccines used overseas.40.          HSA has released the details of reported adverse events on 6 May 2021, which will continue to be published on a routine basis.41.          HSA continues to actively monitor and review the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. In addition to monitoring reports from international regulatory counterparts, HSA also reviews reports from local healthcare practitioners on adverse events following vaccination regardless of whether causality can be established. HSA has appointed 3 expert panels to review neurological, cardiac and hypersensitivity adverse events such as anaphylaxis, which occur following vaccination. This will allow for prompt and appropriate actions to safeguard public health and enhance vaccination safety.42.          Ms Sylvia Lim asked for updates on the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme, or VIFAP for short. As of 3 May, 104 applications have been received. Of the 75 applications reviewed so far, 45 applications have been rejected and 30 applications were assessed by the independent clinical panel to have met the qualifying criteria. These include  21 cases of hypersensitivity allergic reactions, 4 neurology-related cases, 3 cardiology-related cases, and 1 haematology and dermatology-related case each. All of them have since been discharged from hospitals. The remaining 29 applications are pending.Overseas vaccination recognition43.          Ms Cheng Li Hui had asked if we will recognise overseas vaccinations that are not approved by HSA. 44.          As members are aware, Minister for Transport, Mr Ong Ye Kung has shared that we are in discussion with several regions on mutual recognition of vaccination certificate for purposes of travelling. 45.          We will release details once the arrangements are confirmed.Evaluation of Sinovac and other vaccine candidates46.          A few Members have asked about the progress of the evaluation of Sinovac and other vaccine candidates. 47.          As part of our efforts to secure a diversified vaccine portfolio to improve our chances of securing a suitable vaccine that is safe and effective for our population, we have entered into Advance Purchase Agreements (APAs) with several pharmaceutical companies such as Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech and Sinovac last year, even before these vaccines completed their clinical trials.48.          This was how we managed to start our vaccination drive with Pfizer and Moderna vaccines early.49.          Based on the schedules that had been planned for and committed under the advance purchase agreement with Sinovac, Singapore has taken delivery of a shipment of the vaccines.50.          HSA is currently carefully evaluating Sinovac and a few other vaccines for use in Singapore, and we will update the public when we have made progress.Public Education and Outreach 51.          While there has been a concerted effort to encourage the take-up of COVID-19 vaccinations, such as educating the public on why vaccinations are needed, we are aware of vaccination misinformation too. Mr Pritam Singh asked what we are doing about this and how we are addressing this. a.            Overall, public education remains a cornerstone of our vaccination programme. Government agencies have been using multiple platforms including print and broadcast media, social media, direct messaging platforms, and Gov.sg to communicate essential information about the COVID-19 including its vaccines to all segments of society.b.            When the situation calls for it, we will also not hesitate to use legislative levers such as POFMA Correction Directions to stop individuals from spreading mis-information and fear-mongering.52.          All of us have a role to play in stemming the spread of misinformation.53.          Once again, I urge everyone to check that the information they receive comes from reliable sources and make the effort to verify before sharing them.Road ahead54.          We have hit a bump on our path to recovery and the coming few days and weeks are critical as we seek to uncover and break all chains of transmission.55.          This came at an unfortunate time as I know many Singaporeans are looking forward to the upcoming Hari Raya and Vesak Day celebrations.a.            However, the recent community cases show that there remains risks of  COVID-19 outbreaks locally, and we need to remain vigilant to avoid an uncontrolled resurgence of community cases.56.          I want to thank Singaporeans for your understanding, and appeal to everyone to follow the safe distancing measures to prevent further spread of COVID-19 and keep Singapore safe even during this festive season.Reflections of the past year and moving forward57.          The past year has been a tumultuous year. One of the biggest challenges was striking a right balance between saving lives while preserving livelihoods.58.          Our response has not always been perfect. But we have built many new capabilities to meet the new challenges as they emerge. We will continue to learn, improve, be nimble in our response and adapt as the situation evolves.59.          COVID-19 is a global crisis. Our recovery is contingent on the world’s ability to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. With the pandemic still raging in many parts of the world, our fight against COVID-19 will continue for a while yet.60.          I will be handing over the Ministry of Health to Minister Ong Ye Kung shortly, but I will continue to co-chair the Multi-Ministry Task Force together with Minister Lawrence Wong and Minister Ong.61.          I would like to take this opportunity to thank members of the Task Force for their support which has allowed us to mount a whole of Government response to the Pandemic. 62.          I want to particularly thank the healthcare professionals, doctors, nurses, allied health, both in public and private sectors, for their support in our public health and medical aspects of our COVID-19 response. 63.          Finally, I want to thank all Singaporeans for your support and your patience.  Sometimes, we had to move quickly and adjust our measures in quick succession which we know can be very disruptive.  I am glad that Singaporeans could come together as a nation, make personal sacrifices to adapt to the new normal, and all of us can stand shoulder to shoulder in our fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. 64.          This ability for all of us to strive together is the most critical element in our response to COVID-19 that will make all the difference in the eventual outcome.  Let’s continue to work as one and I am sure we will emerge stronger together from this crisis. ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/ministerial-statement-11May,

SGP,Asia,Singapore,14/5/2021,61505,52,27.714,31,0,0,11277.871,9.535,5.082,Updates On Local Situation and Heightened Alert to Minimise Transmission,"        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation. The number of locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and unlinked community cases has continued to increase. This is concerning as the situation could quickly escalate if these cases are not contained swiftly and decisively. Update on Local Situation2.     We have detected several clusters of infections emerging in the past 2 weeks around (i) an ICA officer and his extended family, (ii) Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH), (iii) Tuas South Community Care Facility, and (iv) Pasir Panjang Terminal. Most recently, we have an emerging cluster at Changi Airport Terminal 3 with a total of 46 cases to date. 3.    To reduce the risk of any spread from undetected cases in the community, we have cast a wide net and taken swift action to detect, isolate, and ringfence any possible emerging transmissions to the community. We have carried out mass surveillance testing of persons with possible exposure to cases surrounding these clusters, such as TTSH patients and visitors who were at TTSH during the infectious period. Special testing operations have also been conducted to test port workers who had been deployed at Pasir Panjang Terminal, as well as workers at Changi Airport Terminals 1 and 3 and Jewel Changi Airport. Since 1 May 2021, we have also implemented additional pre-emptive measures to minimise interactions at both social settings and workplaces so as to break the chains of transmission to the community. These measures were further enhanced with effect from 8 May 2021, with reductions in the prevailing group size of social gatherings and the size of larger scale events or activities, to minimise the likelihood of large clusters forming.4.    However, a pattern of local unlinked community cases has emerged and is persisting. This is worrying as it suggests that there may be unknown cases in the community with possible ongoing community transmission and that our earlier and ongoing measures to break the chains of transmissions may be insufficient. We need to act decisively to contain these risks as any one leak could result in an uncontrolled resurgence of cases. Hence we will move to impose targeted restrictions on higher risk settings such as those where there is a high density of people who are unmasked for prolonged periods.Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) in the Fight Against COVID-195.    Following the measures introduced on 8 May 2021, we need to tighten more measures to decisively arrest the increasing number of cases in the community. The following measures will take effect from Sunday 16 May 2021 through Sunday 13 June 2021. A) Further reductions in permissible group size  6.    We will further reduce the current permissible group size of up to 5 persons to up to 2 persons, and the cap of 5 distinct visitors per household per day to 2 distinct visitors per household per day. Individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than 2 per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place.7.    In order to allow families’ current childcare arrangements to continue, grandchildren being cared for by their grandparents on a daily basis would not be counted towards the cap of 2 distinct visitors per household, or to the number of social gatherings per day. However grandparents are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated against COVID-19, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren from COVID-19 infection. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households.B) Minimising Workplace Interactions 8.    Work-from-home will be the default at workplaces. Employers must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so. There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites. Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours. Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed.  Employees may have meal breaks at the workplace, but refrain from  intermingling with their colleagues when their masks are taken off. These measures will lower transmission risks by reducing overall footfall and interactions at common spaces at or near the workplace, and in public places, including public transport.C) Cessation of Indoor “Mask-Off” Activities9.    The recent clusters have demonstrated higher attack rates and secondary transmission occur in mask-off settings, households, and at eateries. To reduce risks of community transmission, indoor “mask-off” activities such as dine-in F&B establishments will cease during this period. Other activities which will also not be allowed during this period include strenuous indoor exercise class or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities. In addition, personalised services which require masks to be removed (e.g. facials and saunas), singing, and the playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind or brass instruments) will also not be allowed. These restrictions will not apply to medical and dental consultations that require patients to have their masks off. Please see details in following paragraphs and in Annex A.10.    Cessation of Dine-in Food and Beverage (F&B). Dine-in F&B establishments are a higher-risk setting as customers often dine for prolonged periods in close proximity with one another with their masks-off. To reduce the risk of community transmission, dine-in F&B establishments (including hawker centres and foodcourts), both indoor and outdoor, will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery options.11.    Reduction of Activity and Event Sizes and Pre-Event Testing Requirements. To minimise the likelihood of large cluster formations, we will further scale down event sizes and lower the event size caps. Pre-event testing (PET) remains an essential measure to help ensure that events can proceed safely for attendees. More details on PET can be found on the MOH website.a.  Congregational and other worship services. Congregational and other worship services may continue with a reduced capacity of 50 attendees at any one time without PET, or up to 100 attendees at any one time with PET implemented. To further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times. Live singing and playing of wind instruments will also be suspended during this period.b.  Shopping malls and showrooms. The occupancy limits for shopping malls and showrooms will be further reduced from the current limit of 10sqm per person of Gross Floor Area (GFA), to 16sqm per person. Odd and even date entry restrictions on Sundays for popular malls will continue.c.  Attractions and shows. The operating capacity of attractions that have received MTI’s prior approval will be reduced to 25% from the current permissible capacity of 50%. Indoor and outdoor shows may proceed with up to 100 persons with PET, and up to 50 persons without PET. d.  Museums and public libraries. Museums and public libraries will be allowed to operate at a reduced capacity of 25%.e.  Cinemas. Up to 100 persons may be allowed into cinema halls with PET implemented. Without PET, only up to 50 persons may be allowed. The prevailing group size of 2 persons applies, and food and beverages may not be sold or consumed in the cinema.f.  MICE and live performances. Up to 100 persons may be allowed with PET, and up to 50 persons may be allowed without PET. Unmasking is not allowed for speakers and performers, and there should be no singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind and brass instruments).g.  Wedding receptions and solemnisations. -   In line with measures on dine-in F&B establishments, wedding receptions will not be allowed.-   Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with PET and 50 participants without PET.  h.  Funerals. The cap for attendees applicable to all days of the funeral, including the burial/ cremation, is 20 persons or less, down from 30 persons currently. Attendees are reminded to maintain safe distancing and keep masks on at all times to reduce the risk of transmission.Targeted Support MeasuresA) Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) Support for F&B Firms12.    In view of the cessation of dining-in at F&B establishments, the Government will increase the JSS support rate to 50% of the first $4,600 of gross monthly wages paid to local employees during the period for which dining-in is prohibited. This is an increase from the 10% support for wages paid up to June 2021.B) One-Month Rental Relief for Hawker Centres and Coffeeshops on Government-owned Premises13.    To support hawkers and coffeeshop stallholders, who are self-employed and do not benefit from the JSS, the Government will provide one month of rental waiver for hawker stall and coffeeshop tenants of Government agencies. Commercial landlords are urged to support their F&B tenants through this period. Use of Face Shields14.    Research has demonstrated that face shields cannot substitute masks in protecting the wearer from droplet infection. More importantly, face shields do not adequately prevent droplet spread if the wearer is infected. Face shields should therefore not be used as a substitute for mask wear, except for medical exceptions; or where the child is 12 years or younger; or for the marriage couple during the solemnisation of their marriage.Expansion of Testing Strategy15.    The above measures will continue to be complemented by our testing, contact tracing, and vaccination capabilities, that we have built up over the past year to manage community spread. Testing, in particular, is one of our key defensive tools to quickly identify individuals who have been exposed to the virus and reduce chances of further spread. Active surveillance and routine testing of targeted groups, such as those with higher risk of exposure to COVID-19, and testing for those diagnosed with Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) with a COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test has enabled quick detection of unlinked cases in the community. For swifter detection of possible cases, we will be also begin Antigen Rapid Testing (ART) for all who present themselves with ARI symptoms at our Swab and Send Home (SASH) Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs), Polyclinics, Emergency Departments and Regional Swab Centres (RSCs). This ART will be done together with the PCR test that all such patients are already subjected to. Both the ART and PCR tests will be funded by the Government for all individuals with ARI symptoms. While the ART is less accurate than the PCR test, and there will be more false positives and false negatives, the ART’s quicker turnaround time compared to a PCR test1 will allow us to take any public health actions more quickly for persons who test positive by ART. 16.    This enhanced testing regime will be rolled out progressively, starting with around 200 SASH PHPCs that are already licensed as ART providers from 15 May 2021, and will be expanded to include all SASH PHPCs through May alongside Polyclinics, Emergency Departments in hospitals, and RSCs. Along with our use of digital tools, such as the TraceTogether and SafeEntry programme, these measures will enable us to quickly identify and draw wide rings around cases and their close contacts.Keeping our Vulnerable and Community Safe17.    Vaccination remains critical in our fight against the pandemic. We have continued to make steady progress with our vaccination programme, having started with our most vulnerable, such as healthcare workers, elderly, and workers with high risks of exposure to COVID-19. As of 13 May 2021, we have administered more than 3.2 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. About 1.9 million individuals have received at least one dose of the vaccine, of whom about 1.3 million individuals have received their second dose and completed the full vaccination regimen.18.    The recent cases illustrate that vaccination may not eliminate the risks of infection completely. However it provides significant protection against infections and helps to reduce the severity of the disease and onward transmission. Vaccination thus remains a key enabler and its ability to help us re-open safely can only be felt when we achieve a high level of population coverage for vaccination. Hence, we urge everyone to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. Observe all safe management measures, see a doctor, and get tested if you feel unwell. It is only together, that we can emerge stronger and safer.  MINISTRY OF HEALTH14 MAY 20211 The time from swab registration to notification of results is typically around 30 minutes for ART, but take up to 48 hours for PCR tests.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-on-local-situation-and-heightened-alert-to-minimise-transmission-14May,

These are blocks where infected cases have been located, and testing is done as a precaution to prevent any possible spread in the community. In the event that a positive case is detected, MOH will isolate the case, identify all close contacts, test and quarantine them to protect the community from further transmission. We will also report updates on any positive cases in our daily press releases.2.      So far, there is only one Housing & Development Board (HDB) block in Singapore with infected cases seen in more than two households. The tests are typically completed within 3 days.BLOCK 506 HOUGANG AVENUE 83.      MOH had identified 10 COVID-19 cases[1], from four different households, residing at 506 Hougang Avenue 8. They are largely Persons Under Quarantine who turned positive for COVID-19. This means that they have been isolated early and ring- fenced, and not likely to be moving around while being infectious. Nevertheless, MOH took all the necessary public health measures to prevent any further spread to the community.4.      We have established that four of the units with confirmed cases are in the same stack, and our initial assessment is that airborne transmission along the stack is highly unlikely. Epidemiological investigations are ongoing to determine linkages and the source of transmission.5.      We are therefore not taking any chances. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has worked with the town council (TC) to carry out stepped up cleaning measures to clean and disinfect the block. At the same time, we are casting our surveillance net as wide as possible, including administering PCR tests for the whole block.6.      MOH has just concluded mandatory PCR tests for 407 residents and visitors of the block. This was done from 21 to 22 May 2021. Thus far, one individual was found to be positive for COVID-19 with 126 more test results pending. More details on the positive case will be reported in upcoming press releases by MOH.7.      Those who are still awaiting their test results are advised to stay at home and seek immediate medical attention if they feel unwell. Individuals who missed their test can proceed to any of the clinics in the Annex between 23 and 24 May 2021 for the mandatory free swab test. They are to bring along their NRIC and TraceTogether Tokens, for identification purposes.BLOCK 559 PASIR RIS STREET 518.      Adopting the same cautious approach, MOH will be conducting mandatory PCR tests on 23 May and 24 May 2021 for all 243 residents of Block 559 Pasir Ris Street 51, as four COVID-19 cases[2] have been detected in two different households living in the block.9.      Residents are advised to go to Coral Regional Screening Centre (Former Coral Primary School) between 23 May to 24 May, 9 am to 12 noon, and 1pm to 4 pm for their tests.10.      Residents can call MOH at 1800-333-9999 if they have queries.STEPPED UP MEASURES BY HDB and NEA11.      The HDB worked with MOH to contact residents living in the affected block to take the PCR test. HDB also deployed safe distancing ambassadors to ensure that safe management measures are in place in the swab ops centre set up at the void deck of the block.12.      Officers from NEA were deployed to closely monitor the cleaning and disinfection works carried out at Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8 and Block 559 Pasir Ris Street 51 by the TCs and their cleaning contractors, to ensure that they were performed in accordance with NEA’s guidelines. Cleaning and disinfection works for Block 506 Hougang Avenue 8 and Block 559 Pasir Ris Street 51 were completed on 21 May and 22 May respectively, with particular attention placed on frequently touched areas, such as lift surfaces, lift buttons, handrails, letterboxes, amongst others. As a precautionary measure, NEA had also worked with the TCs to expand the scope of disinfection to include amenities in the vicinity that could be used by residents, such as playground and central refuse chute.13.      In line with tighter precautionary measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in the community, NEA has reminded all TCs to step up their cleaning standards and implement measures to upkeep good public health hygiene such as increasing the frequency of cleaning of areas with high contact points and adhering to good practices reflected in NEA’s advisory on sanitation and hygiene.ADVISORY ON PROVISION OF SERVICES14.     We are testing the residents in these two blocks as a precaution.

It is a pleasure speaking to you at our annual Work Plan Seminar. There are two priorities – in the short term, win the COVID-19 battle. In the long term, ensure healthcare is affordable to families and also our country; and continue to deliver better healthcare. Let’s first talk about the long term issues.A SUSTAINABLE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM2. Our current national healthcare expenditure has almost doubled from $10 billion in 2010 to $21 billion in 2018, and is expected to increase further in the next decade. This exponential rise is worrying.3. In terms of public expenditure, by 2030, around 3% of GDP, will go to healthcare.Love, Rationality and Time4. Why is healthcare expenditure rising so rapidly? We can decipher the reasons if we look at our own experiences.5. When we are young, our healthcare bills are lower. We only need to visit our regular GP usually for health screening, with most having no chronic illness. As we become old, we have more illnesses.6. When illnesses strike, we may consult different doctors and specialists, even put ourselves through different treatments. Some are expensive, especially the newer options. We may still try them out, even if effectiveness is not so proven. Because our family members love us, and will want to do their best for us.7. Fortunately, we are covered by MediShield Life. On top of that, many of us also bought Integrated Shield plans. With an as-charged Integrated Plan plus a rider, we may pay very little or no out-of-pocket expenses for private care.8. But the problem is that while such a worry-free plan may work for us now, it creates problems for future generations.9. It’s the classic buffet syndrome. Insurance companies over time will find it too expensive to sustain, and premiums will go up. When healthcare expenditure goes up, so too subsidies, and that adds pressure to Government’s fiscal position.10. When we aggregate this experience across all households and individuals, it fuels a rise in our national healthcare bill that we will find increasingly hard to afford.11. That is my simplified way of explaining escalating healthcare cost all over the world. It is driven by powerful forces – love, rationality and the march of time.12. Our love for family members means we often spare no expenses on healthcare. With full insurance coverage, it becomes rational for us to spend without worry because someone else is paying. And with time, we inevitably get older and have more illnesses, and this is compounded by unhealthy lifestyles which often start from young and have irreversible consequences.Beyond Quality to Value13. Taming healthcare costs is therefore not about denying quality healthcare. It is about dealing with these powerful forces, so that we spend wisely, effectively, reduce wastage, and keep it affordable for families and our country. Our society is ageing, but we cannot let rising healthcare costs cripple our future.14. The approach is captured in one of MOH’s vision of the Three Beyonds – from quality to value. There are concrete things that we must do.15. One, containing the cost of drugs and treatments. We have to evaluate which are the most cost-effective. From there, maintain a list, align it to our subsidy framework and even insurance claim limits, and negotiate with suppliers to ensure that the prices charged are commensurate with the outcomes they deliver.16. This is a tried and tested approach adopted by many countries. We have many treatments and drugs covered under the Standard Drug List, but we can expand to cover more under this framework.17. Two, we need to rein in cost inflation fuelled by insurance. Healthcare insurance serves an important purpose, which is why MediShield Life is designed to cover all Singapore residents.18. The key is to ensure that we do not inadvertently erode the spirit of co-payment. Once there is some skin in the game, consumers will exercise prudence in healthcare spending and doctors will exercise more discretion in recommending the appropriate treatments.19. Three, we need to deliver better healthcare. Better does not necessarily means more expensive. Instead, it can be more efficient, patient-centric, and affordable. This is the next topic I want to talk about.DELIVERING BETTER HEALTHCARE20. A lot has been accomplished over the past years, and more are being done.21. For example, major efforts are underway to develop our healthcare infrastructure – expanding the number of polyclinics, building new nursing homes, community and acute hospitals in Woodlands and Bedok. They form a comprehensive continuum of healthcare services.22. IT systems are being revamped; private GPs are being brought into networks; community healthcare outposts and urgent care centres have been set up.23. Intervention has gone upstream as population health is deservedly receiving strong attention. Whether it is war on sugar, battle with salt, alliance with exercise – the Health Promotion Board and our clusters must integrate their efforts and do what it takes to reshape lifestyles. After all, we are Ministry of Health, not Healthcare. 24. Let me share what I think we should not do, and what we should do.25. What we should not do is to further review the structure of our clusters. Our hospital structure has moved from two clusters, to six, and then to three. There are pros and cons to being big or small. Big clusters have scale and comprehensive capabilities. Small hospitals can be agile and innovative.26. We should continue with the structure that we have. Within each cluster, we will have to find ways to make space for skunkworks, and make unorthodox ideas become mainstream. Bring out the best of both worlds.27. What we should do is to press on with the other two Beyonds – from hospital to community, from healthcare to health – towards a more patient-centric, efficient, and effective healthcare delivery system.28. Let’s find the three or four most strategic and transformative priority moves, use the next few years to pilot and scale them across the healthcare delivery system.29. These priority moves must achieve the following. It must mean a more holistic and seamless way of taking care of our patients, leveraging the GPs and polyclinics, acute care hospitals, community hospitals, to intermediate and long-term care options, pharmacists, and community nursing care.30. The centre of gravity must shift away from the acute care hospital, towards the community, with focus on appropriate care in the right setting. Patients will benefit from less hassle, greater accessibility to care, and at lower cost. Long-term chronic care is one area that will benefit from more healthcare delivered in community settings.31. That way, our already heavily loaded hospitals can then focus on patients who need specialist care or emergency cases. At the same time, numerous primary healthcare providers in the community can take on larger roles.32. For patients in rehabilitation, they should ‘step-up’, not step-down, to community hospitals and long-term care facilities. The multidisciplinary team, often consisting of geriatricians, allied health professionals and medical social workers, at community hospitals can provide the right care at the right site for medically stable patients requiring rehabilitation.33. Polyclinics have already become community institutions, providing continuing and holistic care to patients. We will benefit from private GPs becoming an integral part of the continuum for healthcare.34. A GP’s care for his patient goes beyond the four walls of his private clinic. He can be the village doctor that understands the patient and his family, helps them manage chronic diseases; the confidant that stubborn family members listen to, and often the link to the wider healthcare network.35. Pharmacists can also be more empowered to play important complementary roles, such as providing trusted information on drugs, prescribing certain drugs, and educating patients on proper use of medication to reduce re-admission to hospitals.36. The frontline empowerment extends to our nurses too. Equipped with enhanced clinical skills and evidence-based practice, they are increasingly doing frontline work in the community. Advanced Practice Nurses trained in the diagnosis and management of common medical conditions can order tests and prescribe medicines, helping  patients save time and cost.37. Our entire resourcing system must uphold and engender these imperatives. The objectives, outcomes and incentive signals must percolate from MOH HQ to the cluster CEO to every frontline healthcare worker.38. I am heartened by your passion to serve patients and the clear sense of purpose and change we need to bring. I look forward to working with you to tackle the big challenges before us.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/ministry-of-health-work-plan-seminar-2021-opening-address-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-25-may-2021-(part-1-of-2),

This is to give greater peace of mind for those deciding on taking up the vaccination. Individuals may submit a VIFAP application, which must be accompanied by the “Request for Medical Information” form completed by the attending doctor. More information on the application process and requirements can be found at https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/vifap.  As medical conditions that occur after vaccination can be potentially caused by different factors, the independent clinical panel appointed by the Ministry of Health (MOH) will review the medical information submitted as part of the application, and assess the relatedness and severity of the side effect(s) of the condition to the COVID-19 vaccination. The amount of financial assistance provided is dependent on the severity of the serious side effect. For example, an individual who experiences serious side effects attributed to the COVID-19 vaccines, required inpatient hospitalisation and medical intervention, and subsequently recovers, may qualify for a one-time VIFAP pay-out of $2,000. MOH has contacted Raffles Hospital, who confirmed that while the Request for Medical Information form for Mr Chen’s wife had been duly completed, they had not returned the form to Mr Chen. MOH also informed Mr Chen to proceed with the VIFAP application for his wife. Vaccinated persons such as Mr Chen’s wife, who experienced and required medical attention for side effects after COVID-19 vaccination, can continue to receive support for medical expenses through applicable healthcare financing schemes, such as MediShield Life and subsidies at our public healthcare institutions. Vernon Lee (Assoc Prof)Director, Communicable Diseases DivisionMinistry of Health ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/vaccine-injury-financial-assistance-programme-application-must-be-completed-by-attending-doctor,

SGP,Asia,Singapore,18/6/2021,62382,16,19.571,34,0,0,11438.683,2.934,3.589,Calibrated Reopening to Keep Our Community Safe,"            The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) had earlier announced a calibrated reopening to Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) starting with Stage 1 on Monday, 14 June 2021, and a further reopening with Stage 2 on Monday, 21 June 2021. The MTF would like to thank all Singaporeans and residents for their efforts in ensuring a safe and gradual transition. While the collective efforts of Singaporeans over the past few weeks have helped slow the chains of transmission, unlinked cases continue to emerge. These suggest that undetected community transmission persists. Hence, we must continue to exercise good hygiene habits, remain vigilant and carefully recalibrate our reopening to keep our community safe.Update on Local Situation2.         Since the start of Stage 1 of our calibrated reopening, we have seen a small and persistent number of unlinked cases which have the potential to spark larger clusters, such as the one around 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre. To reduce the risk of further spread and ringfence possible emerging transmissions arising from this cluster, we have carried out special testing operations for all staff and tenants working at 115 and 116 Bukit Merah View, and extended free COVID-19 testing to members of the public who had visited these two blocks on days when the infectious individuals had also been present.3.         To protect groups who frequently interact with members of our community, we have offered prioritised vaccinations since March 2021 to those who work in hawker centres and markets. We encourage eligible individuals working in such settings, who are medically eligible, to come forward for vaccination.Updated Approach to Gradual Reopening to Phase 3 (Heightened Alert)4.         Due to the persistence of such undetected community transmission cases, we are calibrating our reopening plans. From 21 June 2021, higher-risk activities such as dining-in at F&B establishments and indoor mask-off sports/exercise will only be allowed to resume in group sizes of up to 2 persons, instead of up to 5 persons as previously announced. Concurrently, we will onboard staff in these settings as quickly as possible onto regular Fast and Easy Tests (FET), starting with using antigen rapid tests (ART). In the coming weeks, we will build up the capacity for FET, and expect a regular FET regime to be in place for those working in these settings by around mid-July. Hence, barring another superspreader event or big cluster, we will allow such activities to increase to group sizes of up to 5 persons from mid-July 2021 (date to be announced later).  5.         The updated measures for F&B establishments, indoor-mask off activities, and wedding receptions are detailed in the following paragraphs (please refer to Annex A for full details on the updated measures, including for other activities where applicable):6.         Resumption of Dining-In at F&B establishments. F&B establishments will be able to resume dining-in from 21 June 2021 in group sizes of up to 2 persons. This means that a group of more than 2 persons who are not from the same household is not allowed to dine-in together at F&B establishments, even if they are split across multiple tables. To further mitigate the risk of transmission from patrons talking loudly, recorded music will not be allowed in F&B establishments. This is in addition to the current restrictions on videos/TV screening and live entertainment at F&B establishments. F&B establishments are also reminded to strictly observe safe distancing of at least 1 metre between groups of diners, of no more than two persons per group, to lower the risk of transmission. Enforcement will be stepped up and we will take firmer enforcement action for any breaches of safe management measures. Patrons must keep their masks on at all times, except when eating or drinking.7.         Wedding receptions. As wedding receptions are higher-risk activities where attendees tend to socialise more and over a longer period of time, wedding receptions will remain prohibited until mid-July 2021.8.         Indoor mask-off sports/ exercise activities. Gyms and fitness studios may resume indoor mask-off sports/ exercise activities in group sizes of up to 2 persons, and in classes of up to 30 persons including the instructor, with safe distancing of at least 2m between individuals and 3m between groups. For mask-on activities and outdoor mask-off activities, these can continue in groups of no more than 5 persons, in classes of up to 30 persons including the instructor. SportSG will release more details on this.Work-from-home Remains the Default9.         As we transition through Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) in the coming weeks, we must control transmission risks by reducing overall interaction within workplaces, and in public places including public transport. Thus, work-from-home will continue to remain the default arrangement. Employers are reminded to ensure the practice continues, and for employees that need to come to the workplace, to stagger their start times and implement flexible working hours. There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites. For workplaces, social gatherings continue to be disallowed, and work-related events (e.g. product launches, townhalls) should continue to disallow F&B.Targeted Support Measures10.        In view of the continued tightened safe management measures of various activities until mid-July 2021, the Government will extend the current enhancements to the Jobs Support Scheme for affected sectors by 3 weeks before tapering it down to 10% for another 2 weeks (please refer to Annex B for details).11.        To provide targeted support to hawkers who are self-employed, the Government will extend the subsidies for fees for table-cleaning and centralised dishwashing services, and provide rental waivers, till mid-July 2021 for stallholders in centres managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators.12.        To help other workers who remain affected by the extended tightened safe management measures, the Government will also extend the COVID-19 Recovery Grant (Temporary) [CRG-T] until 31 July 2021. Existing CRG-T recipients who continue to require assistance can also apply for a second tranche of CRG-T support in July. The Ministry of Social and Family Development will share more details.Update on Phased Roll Out of Regular Fast and Easy Tests (FET) for Staff Involved in Higher-Risk Activities13.        We will require all staff who work at settings with unmasked clients/patrons, or where there is prolonged contact between individuals, to be placed on a regular FET regime, using tests such as ART. These include staff of:a.         Dine-in F&B establishments;b.         Personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/ saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services); andc.         Gyms and fitness studios where clients are unmasked.14.        The regular 14-day FET requirement for staff at these settings will be made mandatory from around mid-July 2021. We expect that most of the FET can be done through a system of self-swabs supervised by the employer. To support establishments in their efforts to get started on FET, we have set up training programmes that companies can leverage to train supervisors in their establishments to supervise ART self-swabs for their staff. These supervisor training programmes will be provided at no cost to these establishments for the next 3 months. ART kits will also be made available to establishments for these employer supervised self-swabs.  Some F&B establishments have already sent their employees for training and are ready to implement regular testing progressively from 21 June 2021.15.        There may be small businesses who are unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on their own. Hence we will also set up Quick Test Centres (QTCs) to support those who need to be tested.  We will start with one each at Tekka and Yishun which will be operational from 21 June 2021. More QTCs will be progressively set up. To further minimise the risks of transmission in these settings, the Government will also facilitate earlier vaccination of individuals who work in these settings.16.        Agencies will provide more information on the regular FET requirements to the identified sectors.Introduction of COVID-19 testing via ART for Visitors of Residential Care Homes Serving Elderly, upon the Resumption of Visits on 21 June 202117.        Visits to residential care homes serving elderly (“Homes”) had been suspended from 5 June 2021 through 20 June 2021 in light of the recent cases of community transmission. We have been working with the Homes to strengthen their existing suite of precautionary measures, including reviewing the visitor management and testing policies to safeguard the health of the seniors.18.        To enhance existing visitor management measures when physical visits resume from 21 June 2021, visitors to Homes will need to take a FET at the Home and test negative prior to entry. Homes will be using ARTs for this purpose. We seek the patience and understanding of visitors that some Homes may require more time to put in place the necessary procedures for ART and will only be able to resume visits at a later date. Other Homes may start off with a smaller number of visitors to allow them to stabilise their operational processes before accommodating a larger number of visits. Visitors should continue to schedule visits with the Home ahead of time, and take into consideration the added time required to complete the ART.Deployment of SafeEntry Gateway Check-Out Boxes19.        In the coming weeks, to strengthen the TraceTogether (TT) and SafeEntry (SE) Programmes, which are critical digital tools to facilitate contact tracing and bring down community spread, SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) Check-Out Boxes will also be rolled out progressively at venues with high footfall to facilitate SE check-outs. This follows public feedback from SEGW users who want to perform SE check-out, but are unable to do so currently. This will help to facilitate more precise contact tracing efforts.20.        SEGW Check-Out Boxes will be deployed at venues with higher throughput of visitors (e.g. malls, hospitals and polyclinics), and places where individuals are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods with masks off (e.g. dine-in F&B outlets and gyms). Eligible businesses will be notified and will receive their SEGW Check-Out Boxes in the coming weeks.21.        Members of the public are encouraged to perform SE check-out when leaving the premises as far as possible. This information will support the contact tracing process by providing more details for the identification of close contacts.Strengthening Ringfencing Around Cases22.        Given the increased transmissibility of viral strains, we will use TT and SE data to strengthen our ringfencing around cases to prevent large clusters from arising. This will give us greater confidence to resume more activities while preventing transmissions. As part of this measure, we will be sending ‘Health Alerts’ via SMS to individuals, who have visited hotspots on the same days as the infected persons, and may have been exposed to the virus. These individuals will be required to undergo mandatory testing at designated testing centres and stay isolated until they receive their results. While the risk of infection is lower if they were to test negative, they should continue to limit their interactions with others as an added precaution and restrict their activities to only those which are essential. In particular those who need to go to work (i.e. cannot work from home) will be allowed to do so. However, they must comply strictly with all the safe management measures at the workplace. Furthermore, at the testing centres, we will give them DIY test kits, which they will need to self-administer at home over the subsequent days to confirm that they are not infected. We will need all Singaporeans to play their part.  Further details will be announced when ready.Keeping Our Community Safe23.        The persistence of unlinked cases suggests that there are undetected cases in the community. Until we achieve a higher rate of vaccination within our population, public health measures such as testing, ringfencing, and calibrated reopenings continue to be our best defences against the virus. Individually, we must continue to observe all the safe management measures, practise good hygiene, and see a doctor and be tested when sick.24.        In the coming few months, vaccination is our key enabler, both to reduce the risk of transmission, and to reduce the severity of disease for those who are unfortunately still infected. Its ability to help Singapore reopen safely can only be felt when we can collectively achieve a high level of population coverage for vaccination. Hence, we urge everyone who are eligible to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. It is only by working together, that we can emerge stronger and safer. MINISTRY OF HEALTH18 JUNE 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/calibrated-reopening-to-keep-our-community-safe,

From 23 June 2021, 2359 hours, all new travellers arriving from higher risk countries/regions will be subject to a 14-day SHN, instead of 21 days at dedicated SHN facilities. Reviewing Border Measures to Manage Risks 2.   In late-April 2021, little was known about the emerging variant of concern, including its incubation period. As a precaution, we had required travellers with recent travel history to higher risk countries/regions [1] to serve a 21-day SHN. We have since reviewed the international evidence and local case data.3.   While there is increased transmissibility with the new variants of concern, we have found no evidence – from both overseas and local data – that these variants come with longer incubation periods. Since we introduced the 21-day SHN for all travellers with recent travel history to higher risk countries/regions from 8 May 2021, we have had 270 imported cases among such travellers (as of 22 June 2021). All of them had incubation periods well within the 14-day window. As such, we will reduce the SHN period from 21 days back to 14 days.4.   However, given the higher transmissibility of new variants of concern, and to identify potential infection cases early and provide infected travellers with appropriate medical care as soon as possible, travellers will be required to test themselves regularly with antigen rapid test (ART) self-test kits on Days 3, 7 and 11 of their arrival in Singapore, while serving their SHN [2]. This is on top of the COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests they have to take on arrival in Singapore, and on Day 14 of their arrival, before they exit SHN.5.   In summary, we will implement the following changes to the SHN regime:a)   From 23 June 2021, 2359 hours, all travellers with recent travel history in the past 21 days to higher risk countries/regions immediately prior to arrival in Singapore, will only be required to complete 14 days of their SHN at dedicated SHN facilities [3]. They will undergo COVID-19 PCR tests on-arrival [4] and on Day 14 of their arrival. They will be allowed to end their SHN as long as they have a negative result for their PCR test on Day 14 of their arrival [5].b)   Travellers who had stayed in Taiwan and Israel in the 21 days immediately prior to arrival in Singapore were previously subjected to a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities, and an additional 7-day SHN at their place of residence. From 23 June 2021, 2359 hours, travellers who had stayed in these countries/regions in the 21 days immediately prior to their arrival in Singapore will be allowed to apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities before arrival and serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence, if they fulfil the following criteria:i) Travelled to no other country/region other than the above-mentioned countries/regions [6], in the last consecutive 21 days immediately prior to entry into Singapore; and ii) Are occupying their place of residence (i.e. residential address) alone, or only with household members who are also persons serving SHN with the same travel history and duration of SHN.c)    Refund details are being worked out for travellers who are affected by these changes, and will be shared with them separately.d)    Besides the on-arrival PCR test and PCR test on Day 14 of arrival, all travellers [7] serving the SHN in dedicated SHN facilities will also undergo ART self-administered tests on Days 3, 7 and 11 of their arrival. This new requirement will be implemented for new arrivals from 27 Jun 2021, 2359 hours.6.    Newly arrived migrant workers from higher-risk countries/regions [8] and staying in dormitories or working in the Construction, Marine and Process (CMP) sector will continue to go through an additional 7-day stay at the Migrant Worker Onboarding Centre (MWOC) or a dedicated facility after they are cleared from their 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities. This additional 7-day stay that has been in place since early this year, will include an additional testing regime, medical examination and Settling-In-Programme (SIP), where required. This precautionary measure will further minimise any small risk of imported COVID-19 positive cases transmitting the virus into the dormitories or at the worksites which can result in large clusters, and will be regularly reviewed as the COVID-19 situation evolves.7.    New crew from higher risk countries/regions who are entering Singapore on a long-term permit to work onboard harbour craft operating in the Port of Singapore will undergo an additional 7-day stay and testing regime at a dedicated facility after they are cleared from their 14-day SHN in Singapore before commencing work onboard the harbour craft. This will serve as a precaution in view of the essential marine services that the harbour craft provide to support our supply chain.8.    As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures to manage the risk of importation and transmission to the community. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website.     [1] As of 23 June 2021, this refers to all countries/regions except Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Hong Kong, Macao, Mainland China, and New Zealand. Please refer to the Safe Travel Office Website for updates to the countries/regions identified.   [2] Travellers serving their SHN in dedicated SHN facilities will collect their ART self-test kits from the facilities after arrival in Singapore.   [3] Affected travellers who are currently serving SHN will have their SHN reviewed and be informed of check-out arrangements separately.    [4] To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the airport, travellers are strongly encouraged to register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore at https://safetravel.changiairport.com.

The group cited reports of the US Centres for Diseases Control and Prevention’s (CDC’s) investigations into the death of a 13-year-old male after being vaccinated with the second dose of an mRNA vaccine. They also claimed that the 13-year-old male from the US had died from heart failure, and highlighted the recent international reports of the association between myocarditis and dose 2 of the mRNA vaccines in young men. 2          The said news report actually did not state death from heart failure as alleged, and the matter is still under investigation by the US authorities. The writers also chose to highlight only one of the presentations to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the CDC, but failed to mention the point stated in its summary slide that “available data indicate that patients generally recover from symptoms and do well”. They also failed to mention that subsequent discussions at the same meeting went on to support the vaccination of adolescents because the benefits outweighed the risks. 3          The use of safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore is of paramount concern to the Expert Committee, and we are closely monitoring local and international data to ensure our recommendations are up to date. The Expert Committee had on 11 June 2021 highlighted the possibility of a small risk of myocarditis and pericarditis associated with the second dose of the mRNA vaccines, and the assessment is that the benefits of receiving the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination. The data on myocarditis and pericarditis has not changed, and the Expert Committee’s assessment holds. 4          The risks of acquiring COVID-19 and suffering damaging illness outweigh the risk of vaccination. A meta-analysis of 129 studies from 31 countries involving 10,251 children found that 22.9% of children diagnosed with COVID-19 had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and 3.6% died. In the US alone, of the around 4 million children infected with COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, we have seen around 380 reported cases of deaths in the age group 12 to 17 years, and COVID-19 in the young can result in Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and other prolonged disability. In the face of a more transmissible Delta variant associated with more severe COVID-19, it is imperative that we protect our children from severe COVID-19 and its complications. This will have to mean full vaccination of two doses, as studies showed that one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine confers 33% protection against the Delta variant. In fact, Israel has recently started vaccinating teenagers after the Delta variant caused school outbreaks as well, despite earlier news reports stating a more ambivalent position. 5          The data reported from the US indicates that cases of myocarditis following mRNA vaccinations are rare. In addition, among the small number of cases, almost all had resolved. Professional medical associations in the US, including the American College of Paediatrics and the American Heart Association in the US have continued to strongly encourage vaccination in everyone aged 12 years and older. Nevertheless, we understand the anxiety parents face, and hence we endorse MOH’s position to make vaccination voluntary in Singapore, even as it is strongly encouraged. 6          The Expert Committee continues to recommend the use of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines for young men. However, as a precaution, vaccinated persons, in particular adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after their second dose. During this time, they should seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. The Expert Committee notes that MOH had also issued guidance to all doctors to properly advise patients on the care they receive. 7          The Expert Committee will continue to monitor the local and international data and will review its recommendations as needed.  EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION28 JUNE 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/benefits-of-mrna-covid-19-vaccines-continue-to-outweigh-the-risk-of-vaccination,

Mr Tan had been identified as a close contact of a COVID-19 case who had tested positive for COVID-19 infection on 18 June, based on TraceTogether data, and was issued a quarantine order on the same day.For contact tracing, we rely on a variety of tools, including SafeEntry data, TraceTogether Bluetooth data, as well as interviews with the infected individuals to identify possible contacts. The exposure alerts on the TraceTogether app are generated purely from SafeEntry data, and show possible exposure based on a user's SafeEntry check-in or check-out records from the last 14 days. The intent of the alert is for persons who happen to be in the same general vicinity as a COVID-19 case to monitor their health for 14 days and be advised to see a doctor promptly should they develop symptoms of acute respiratory infection. Such exposure alerts displayed in the TraceTogether app do not cover certain places, such as healthcare facilities. In these areas, visitors, patients and staff movement are better documented, making more targeted identification of contacts possible as compared to places such as shopping malls. Moreover, the risk of exposure at healthcare facilities is controlled through the use of personal protective equipment and the strict adherence to Safe Management Measures and infection control measures. TraceTogether Bluetooth data is used for the identification of close contacts. The TraceTogether Bluetooth function was working as intended in the background, and TraceTogether Bluetooth data led to Mr Tan being identified as a close contact and subsequently placed on quarantine.We would like to remind the public to turn on their TraceTogether app or carry their TraceTogether token at all times when they are out, so that we can quickly identify and isolate close contacts of COVID-19 cases, and limit further transmission.Vernon Lee (Professor)Senior Director, Communicable Diseases DivisionMinistry of Health ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/tracetogether-app's-bluetooth-data-helped-identify-writer-as-close-contact_3July2021,

Following the two stages of gradual reopening to Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) on 14 June and 21 June 2021, we will continue to calibrate the resumption of more economic and community activities. Updates on Local Situation2.      As at 5 July 2021, the number of new cases in the community has decreased from 86 cases in the week before to 28 cases in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has also decreased from 14 cases in the week before to 4 cases in the past week. 3.      Although we have seen a small number of cases that have surfaced, such as the ones around 105 Henderson Crescent and 115 Bukit Merah View Market and Food Centre, we have managed to identify and ringfence the spread through aggressive COVID testing operations and active surveillance in the community. We have slowed down the chains of transmission and are now in a position to ease some community measures further.Updates to Safe Management Measures in Phase 3 (Heightened Alert) from 12 July 20214.       The following updated measures will take effect from 12 July 2021 (please refer to Annex A for full details on the updated safe management measures (SMMs), including for other activities where applicable):5.       Group sizes at Food & Beverage (F&B) establishments. Groups of up to 5 persons will be able to dine-in at F&B establishments. This is aligned with the social gathering group size allowed today. Dining-in remains a higher-risk activity because many people are unmasked and in close proximity with one another. Hence entertainment at F&B establishments, e.g. live entertainment, recorded music, and videos/TV screening, will continue to be prohibited in order to reduce the expulsion of droplets from individuals having to raise their voices over the entertainment. Patrons are reminded to adhere to all other SMMs, e.g. social distancing and keeping masks on at all times except when eating or drinking.6.      Resumption of wedding receptions. Wedding receptions may resume from 12 July 2021, with no more than 250 persons allowed with Pre-Event Testing (PET). For wedding receptions with 50 persons or less, PET will be required for the wedding party only. As wedding receptions are higher-risk activities where attendees tend to socialise more and over a longer period of time, attendees must adhere to all other SMMs to reduce the risk of transmission. Refer to MSF’s advisory for further details. 7.      Indoor high-intensity/ mask-off sports/ exercise activities. Gyms and fitness studios may conduct indoor mask-off sports/ exercise activities in group sizes of up to 5 persons, similar to indoor mask-on and outdoor activities. Sports and exercise classes can continue in groups of no more than 5 persons, in classes of up to 50 persons including the instructor, or the capacity limit of the venue, whichever is lower. SportSG will release more details on this.8.      Social gatherings at the workplace. Work-from-home will continue to remain the default arrangement so as to reduce overall interaction within workplaces and on public transport. Employers are reminded to ensure the practice continues, and for employees that need to come to the workplace, to stagger their start times and implement flexible working hours. Social and recreational gatherings at the workplace will be allowed but must be limited to a total size of no more than 5 persons in line with the broader community rules.Targeted Support Measures9.      As announced earlier, the Government enhanced the Jobs Support Scheme (JSS) for affected sectors from 16 May to 11 July. With the gradual resumption of more economic and community activities, JSS support for these affected sectors will be tapered to 10% for two weeks from 12 to 25 July. Please refer to Annex B for the JSS levels of support for affected sectors.  Updates to Regular Fast and Easy Tests for Staff Involved in Higher-Risk Activities10.      We had earlier announced a progressive roll-out of Fast and Easy Tests (FETs) for staff in higher-risk settings. Since then, we have been working with the businesses to commence FET Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) via Employer-Supervised Self Swab or at Quick Test Centres. Many of the systems are now in place and therefore, from 15 July 2021, FET RRT will be made mandatory for all staff in the following higher-risk settings:  a.  Dine-in F&B establishments;b.  Personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/ saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services); andc.  Gyms and fitness studios where clients are unmasked. Increasing Access to ART Test Kits 11.     We had earlier announced that Over-the-Counter Antigen Rapid Tests (OTC ARTs) would be made available at designated local retail pharmacies from 16 June 2021. From 16 July 2021, we will extend the sale of these ART self-test kits to more general retailers like supermarkets and convenience stores. We will also lift the restriction that caps OTC ART sales at 10 kits per individual. With this, more individuals, particularly those who do not have acute respiratory infection symptoms, can test themselves if they are concerned about potential exposure to COVID-19.Deployment of SafeEntry and SafeEntry Gateway for all Supermarkets12.     We have observed that there is a high volume of patrons in supermarkets, which increases the risk of transmission. To facilitate more targeted contact tracing for individuals who have overlapping visits with infected persons in indoor buildings, TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SE) and SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) check-in requirements will be re-introduced at supermarkets located within TT-only SE buildings with the same operating hours. This will take effect from 21 July 2021. Other supermarkets, e.g. standalone supermarkets, that have been implementing TT-only SE and SEGW check-in facilities will continue to do so. Customers of all supermarkets must check in with their TraceTogether (TT) App or Token using the SEGW, or by scanning the SafeEntry (SE) QR code with the TT App. We encourage all members of public to comply with SE check-in requirements and to carry their TT Token or keep their TT App active to facilitate contact tracing, and help protect themselves and their loved ones.Further Changes to be Made Upon 50% of the Population Completing the Full Vaccination Regimen13.     As Singapore’s vaccination coverage continues to increase, we will introduce differentiated SMMs for vaccinated persons. This will allow individuals who have been fully vaccinated under the national vaccination programme to participate in more community and economic activities. When more people are vaccinated, it reduces the risk of spread from an infected person to another, in particular a non-vaccinated person who is more vulnerable to the disease. 14.     In particular, we are considering the following measures if the situation continues to be stable and when at least half of the population has completed the full vaccination regimen, which is expected to be around end-July 2021:a.  Social gathering group sizes may increase to 8 persons;b.  For activities/venues such as cinemas, congregational worship, MICE events, live performances, spectator sports and wedding solemnizations, we could allow a doubling in the group size if they are attended by fully vaccinated persons1, i.e. up to 500 persons may be allowed;c.  For higher-risk, indoor mask-off activities (e.g. F&B dine-in), we could differentiate the guidelines such that a group size of up to 8 persons may be allowed only for fully vaccinated persons. Otherwise, the group size will remain at 5 persons;  d. Work-from-home will continue to remain the default, but more may be allowed to return to the workplace based on the percentage of total employees who are fully vaccinated.Further details on the above measures and other changes will be announced nearer the implementation date. Towards a COVID-19 Endemic Singapore15.     We have made significant progress in vaccinating the Singapore population since the start of this year and we must not lose our momentum. Even as we plan our transition and public health measures around vaccination milestones, we urge everyone who is eligible to step forward and get vaccinated as soon as possible. We also encourage those who have their second dose appointments scheduled 6 to 8 weeks from their first dose, to bring forward their second dose appointments to 4 weeks. Any further steps towards reopening and a Singapore with endemic COVID-19 will only be possible when more of our population is protected through vaccination. MINISTRY OF HEALTH7 JULY 20211 Fully vaccinated individuals would have received both doses of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccine, with an additional two weeks after the second dose for optimal protection. Recovered individuals would also qualify as they would have developed immunity against the virus. We are mindful about those who are still unvaccinated or are medically ineligible for the two mRNA vaccines, including children 12 years and below. We are considering separate provisions for this group, e.g. allow them to qualify based on a pre-event test, or allow children to qualify, but up to a limit.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-on-phase-3-(heightened-alert)-measures-7Jul,

This is critical as seniors are the most vulnerable group and at higher risk of becoming dangerously ill if infected with COVID-19. With age and possibly underlying health conditions, their immune system is weaker. Without vaccination, they may not be able to fight off the virus. 2.           Currently about 7 in 10 seniors aged 70 and above have completed at least their first vaccination dose.  To enhance convenience for seniors, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will launch up to 10 mobile vaccination teams to the heartlands. These mobile vaccination teams will be deployed at locations near where many seniors live, such as at selected Community Clubs/Centres (CCs) that are not already being used as Vaccination Centres, or at the Residents’ Committee centres at residential blocks. The mobile vaccination team deployment will be done in phases, and has started with Anchorvale CC on 7 July 2021. It will be progressively deployed at Kallang, Whampoa, Changi Simei and Paya Lebar Kovan CCs in the coming weeks. 3.           The mobile vaccination teams will be deployed at each location for a few days to a week, before moving to other locations, and returning to the original location to administer the second vaccination dose. This is to ensure that those who had receive the first dose will get their second dose at the same location. 4.           The deployment location and schedule of the mobile vaccination teams in are as follows: Date (for 1st dose)Location  7 July to 13 July Anchorvale CC 14 July to 21 July(closed on 20 July for Hari Raya Haji) Kallang CC Whampoa CC 22 July to 28 July Changi Simei CC 29 July to 4 August Paya Lebar Kovan CC5.            MOH will also call on our primary care providers, including private general practitioners and polyclinics, to help in this national effort. First, we will expand the number of Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) providing COVID-19 vaccination as part of the national vaccination programme, starting with Bedok, Bukit Merah, Hougang and Tampines in the coming weeks. All primary care providers have also been called on to help persuade seniors who are their regular patients, to go for their COVID-19 vaccination if they have not done so yet.6.            Staff and volunteers from the PA and AIC’s outreach arm, Silver Generation Office (SGO) will also intensify their ground outreach efforts. They will reach out to the unvaccinated seniors through house visits and engagement dialogues to address any queries or concerns they might have. They will also provide advice on the nearest vaccination locations and assist those who require help in getting to the vaccination centres, or arrange for them to be vaccinated at home if they are homebound.7.            We strongly urge seniors to be vaccinated by these mobile vaccination teams as they are deployed to a location near to them, to protect themselves, their senior friends and their loved ones. Seniors aged 60 years old and above may also walk into any of the existing Vaccination Centres with their Identity Card to receive their first dose of vaccination, without any prior appointment needed, or visit their doctors at any of the participating PHPCs or polyclinics. Homebound persons can also directly request to receive their vaccination at home, by calling the SGO hotline at 1800-650-6060. To target this service to seniors who really need it, this service will be strictly reserved for those who are homebound.8.            Vaccination remains a key enabler in our fight against COVID-19. Together, we can help Singapore to re-open safely if we each contribute to achieve a high level of population vaccination coverage. We encourage all who have yet to be vaccinated, to register your interest via vaccine.gov.sg and book your appointment to get vaccinated.  MINISTRY OF HEALTH15 JULY 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/bringing-covid-19-vaccination-to-the-heartlands-for-seniors,

Stallholders who receive a negative PCR test result are able to resume business immediately.4.     In addition to the PCR test, fresh fish and seafood stallholders will be issued with self-test Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits and are required to self-administer an ART test on the seventh day from the last exposure. They will also be required to undergo another PCR test at designated testing centres around the 14th day from their date of last known exposure.5.     MOH has also arranged with NEA to conduct COVID-19 testing for all stallholders and stall assistants of market stalls and cooked food stalls at hawker centres and markets managed by NEA or NEA-appointed operators. These stallholders and stall assistants will receive an SMS notification with details of the scheduled test. Stalls not selling fresh fish or seafood can remain in operation while the testing of stallholders is taking place over the next few days. We urge all stallholders and stall assistants to get tested, for their benefit and that of their patrons. 6.     We advise all visitors to the markets and food centres to avoid crowds, to visit during off-peak hours where possible, and to strictly observe safe management measures.

Since then, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has uncovered more clusters linked to the Jurong Fishery Port, especially in wet markets and hawker food centres. This is very concerning, as it can affect many people in our community all over the island.2. Furthermore, unlike the KTV cluster, which had spread first amongst younger population segments, the current wave of infection affects a wider spectrum of the population including many seniors. At the current rate of transmission, it is likely that infection cases will rise sharply, and many people in the community will catch the virus. While close to 50% of the population have completed their vaccination regimen, there remains a number of vulnerable individuals, such as our seniors, who have yet to take up vaccination. Unvaccinated individuals are at higher risk of being infected, and higher risk of being seriously ill if infected. Hence, in the meantime, we must act decisively to contain the current outbreak and minimise the risk of our hospital capacity being overwhelmed, while we race ahead to vaccinate those who have not completed or started their vaccination. We remain on track to having two-thirds of our population complete the vaccination regimen by National Day, and are aiming for much higher coverage amongst our seniors.Update on Local Situation3. Within the community, we have several clusters emerging around (i) multiple nightlife establishments, (ii) the Jurong Fishery Port (JFP), and (iii) several wet markets and hawker food centres. We have cast a wide net and are testing widely to ringfence possible emerging transmissions. We have placed all JFP workers under quarantine and have started mass surveillance testing of all stallholders and stall assistants of market and cooked food stalls at markets and hawker centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or NEA-appointed operators. NEA and Town Councils have also started progressively implementing access control with interim fencing and mandatory SafeEntry check-in at markets where COVID-19 cases have been detected amongst stallholders and stall assistants. Residents living near such markets are advised to minimise their movement and social interactions, and to collect and perform self-testing using antigen rapid test (ART) kits that will be made available at Residents’ Committee Centres near them. Those who are vaccinated but who live with seniors who are unvaccinated should also limit their social interactions and movement, as they may inadvertently bring the virus home and infect the unvaccinated seniors.4. Despite these measures, the number of community linked and unlinked cases has continued to escalate. Between 12 July 2021 and 18 July 2021, we detected an average of 46 community cases per day. This is the highest number of cases we have detected since April 2020. The porous nature of wet markets and hawker food centres which serve a range of customers including vulnerable seniors, also increases the risk of undetected cryptic transmission. As we continue to conduct extensive testing for individuals exposed to the risk of infection, we can expect case numbers to increase in the coming days. With the growing number of clusters linked to JFP, the ongoing measures to break the chains of transmission may not be sufficient.Reversion to Safe Management Measures for Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) 5. We will therefore be further tightening community safe management measures by going back to Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)1. The following measures will take effect from 22 July 2021 through 18 August 2021 and will supersede those that were introduced on 19 July 2021. We will do a review of the measures two weeks after implementation, and will adjust further based on the infection situation at that time. Please refer to Annex A for full details on the updated safe management measures.Permissible Group Sizes6. Permissible group sizes for social gatherings will be reduced from maximum of 5 persons to maximum of 2 persons, together with a cap of 2 distinct visitors per household per day. Individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than 2 per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place.7. To allow families’ current childcare arrangements to continue, grandchildren being cared for daily by their grandparents will not be counted towards the cap of 2 distinct visitors per household, or to the number of social gatherings per day. Grandparents are strongly encouraged to be vaccinated against COVID-19, to protect both themselves and their grandchildren. To reduce the risk of transmission, grandparents should also minimise intermingling between grandchildren from different households.Minimising Workplace Interactions8. Work-from-home will continue to be the default at workplaces. Employers must ensure that employees who are able to work from home do so. There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites. Employers should continue to stagger the start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours. Social gatherings at the workplace will not be allowed.Cessation of Mask-Off Activities9. To reduce the risks of community transmission, both indoor and outdoor dine-in F&B establishments (including hawker centres and food courts) will only be able to offer takeaway and delivery options. Strenuous indoor exercise classes, or strenuous individual and group indoor sports and exercise activities, will also cease. In addition, personalised services which require masks to be removed (e.g. facials, saunas, make-up services), singing, and the playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind or brass instruments) will also not be allowed. These restrictions will not apply to medical and dental consultations that require patients to have their masks removed. Non-medical facial treatments will not be exempted from these restrictions.10. Staff who work at settings with unmasked clients/patrons and were placed on mandatory regular Fast and Easy Test (FET) regimes beginning from mid-July, will not be required to conduct FETs during this period if their business operations are suspended. For businesses that continue to remain open (including F&B outlets that stay open for delivery/ takeaways), their staff must continue with the regular 14-day FET requirement. Such regular FET will continue to be made free of charge during this period.Reduction of Activity and Event Sizes and Pre-Event Testing Requirements11. To minimise the likelihood of large cluster formations, we will scale down event sizes and lower the event size caps. Pre-event testing (PET) remains an essential measure to help ensure that events can proceed safely for attendees.a. Live performances and MICE. Up to 100 persons may be allowed with PET, and up to 50 persons may be allowed without PET. Unmasking is not allowed for speakers and performers, and there should be no singing or playing of instruments that require intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind and brass instruments).b. Spectator and participatory sports events. Up to 100 persons may be allowed for spectator and participatory sports events with PET implemented. PET would not be required if there are 50 persons or less. Further details will be issued by SportSG.c. Marriage solemnisations and wedding receptions. Marriage solemnisations may continue for up to 100 participants with PET, and 50 participants without PET. We acknowledge that wedding couples have faced significant uncertainties over the past few months. Hence, as a special provision, wedding receptions may be allowed to continue with up to 100 persons with PET for all persons, and with a group size of up to 5 persons per table. This will allow couples to continue with their wedding plans, albeit with some adjustments. All wedding guests must strictly abide by the safe management measures, and in particular maintain social distancing and avoid mingling with others beyond their own table. Given their higher vulnerability, we also strongly discourage unvaccinated individuals from attending such events until they are fully vaccinated.d. Attractions and shows. The operating capacity of attractions that have received MTI’s prior approval will be reduced to 25% from the current permissible capacity of 50%. Indoor and outdoor shows may proceed with up to 100 persons with PET, and up to 50 persons without PET.e. Cinemas. Up to 100 persons may be allowed into cinema halls with PET implemented. Only up to 50 persons may be allowed without PET. The prevailing group size of 2 persons applies, and food and beverages may not be sold or consumed in the cinema.f. Congregational and other worship services. Congregational and other worship services may continue with up to 100 persons with PET, and up to 50 persons may be allowed without PET. To further mitigate the risk of spread through aerosol transmissions, religious workers and all other participants must wear their masks at all times. Live singing and playing of wind or brass instruments will also be suspended during this period.g. Museums and public libraries. Museums and public libraries will be allowed to operate at a reduced capacity of 25%.h. Shopping malls and showrooms. The occupancy limits for shopping malls and showrooms will be reduced from the current limit of 10sqm per person of Gross Floor Area, to 16sqm per person.Targeted Support Measures12. In view of the tightened safe management measures until 18 August 2021, the Government will provide a support package to affected businesses and workers. The package will take reference from the support provided in the previous Phase Two (Heightened Alert). The Ministry of Finance will announce more details in the next few days.Mandatory SafeEntry Check-in at Wet Markets and Hawker Centres Island-wide13. Wet markets and hawker centres are places frequently visited by members of the community and are also where many seniors tend to congregate. The potential for transmission is high given the close proximity between individuals or mask-off activities, as evidenced by the recent clusters detected at these settings. There is a need to facilitate quicker contact tracing efforts so that potential transmission at these settings can be curbed. As announced on 18 July 2021, NEA and the Town Councils will be progressively implementing access control with interim fencing and mandatory SafeEntry (SE) check-in at markets where COVID-19 cases have been detected amongst stallholders or stall assistants.14. In the coming weeks, we will progressively introduce TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SE) and SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) check-in requirements at all other wet markets and hawker centres island-wide. This means that everyone entering wet markets and hawker centres must check in with their TraceTogether (TT) App or Token using the SEGW, or by scanning the SE QR code with the TT App. We encourage all members of public to comply with SE check-in requirements and to carry their TT Token or keep their TT App active to facilitate contact tracing, and help protect themselves and their loved ones.Towards a COVID-19 Resilient Singapore15. We have made significant progress in vaccinating the Singapore population and we must not lose our momentum. As Singapore’s vaccination coverage continues to increase, we will re-introduce vaccination differentiated SMMs at an appropriate time. This will allow individuals who have been fully vaccinated under the national vaccination programme to participate in more community and economic activities, and in larger events, while protecting those who are unvaccinated. We urge everyone who is eligible, in particular seniors who are most at risk of developing serious symptoms, to step forward and get vaccinated as soon as possible. We are deploying Mobile Vaccination Teams to estates where there are more unvaccinated seniors. Seniors can also walk into any vaccination centre for their first appointment. We encourage all to register their interest via vaccine.gov.sg and book their appointments.16. During this period of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), we seek everyone’s cooperation to observe all safe management measures so that we can lower transmission risks. This can be done with everyone playing their role to minimise their movement and social interactions so that we can reduce footfall at common spaces at or near the workplace and in public places, including public transport. If you are unwell, see a doctor and get tested. It is only together, that we can emerge stronger and safer.[1] Prevailing from 16 May 2021 to 13 June 2021.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/going-back-to-phase-2-heightened-alert,

Any detection of cases within a hospital will invariably lead to a ward closure, limiting movements of patients and staff in and out of the affected ward. Affected patients and staff will also be placed on quarantine. Such measures while necessary to control further transmission of the virus, will have an adverse impact on hospitals’ capacity in caring for patients by reducing the availability of hospital staff and bed capacities.2. As an interim measure to reduce the potential transmission in the hospitals, all visitation to hospital wards will be stopped from 5 August to 18 August 2021 (both dates inclusive), except for the patient groups below, who will be allowed visitation on a conditional and case-by-case basis, as assessed by the hospital:a. Patients whose conditions have turned very ill;b. Paediatric patients;c. Birthing/post-partum mothers; andd. Patients requiring additional care support from caregivers. Examples include assistance of inpatients who have mental incapacities and family members who are undergoing caregiver training to better care for their loved ones after hospital discharge.3. For the above groups of patients, only one visitor is allowed per day with visit duration of no more than 30 minutes (at the bedside). For patients who are very ill, up to five pre-designated visitors may be registered, with a maximum of two visitors at the patient’s bedside at any one time of no more than 30 minutes visit duration. Any visitor who requires to stay beyond 30 minutes visit duration such as caregiver training, will only be allowed after the visitor test negative on a supervised antigen rapid test (the validity of the result of this test is 24 hours).4. All visitors to the hospitals must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabrics, and surgical masks. There must be no eating or drinking in the inpatient wards. Visitors must not use the patients’ toilets in the wards and must avoid sitting on patients’ beds.5. Relatedly, in our effort to get more people vaccinated, all patients (inpatient and outpatient) who are unvaccinated will be approached by the hospital healthcare team on COVID-19 vaccination if clinically appropriate. Patients who receive their first dose of COVID-19 vaccination at the hospital should return to the same hospital for their second dose. Vaccinated patients will protect other patients in the hospital and reduce the risk of COVID-19 clusters in the hospitals.6. MOH will review the above measures regularly and we seek the understanding and cooperation of all Singaporeans as we make adjustments to protect our patients and hospitals during this transition period towards a COVID-resilient society.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/interim-tightened-visitor-management-measures-and-opportunistic-patient-covid-19-vaccination-at-all-hospitals,

SGP,Asia,Singapore,6/8/2021,65605,97,106.286,41,1,0.571,12029.668,17.786,19.489,Preparing for Our Transition Towards  Covid Resilience ,"     The Multi-Ministry Taskforce had earlier announced the reversion to Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) from 22 July 2021 through 18 August 2021 to allow us to contain the outbreak of clusters in the community and minimise the risk of our healthcare capacity being overwhelmed while we ramped up our vaccination rates, particularly among seniors. Through the cooperation and efforts of everyone, the situation has stabilised. Infection numbers are stable and more importantly, the number of individuals with severe illnesses and deaths did not rise uncontrollably. Preparing to be a COVID-19 Resilient Nation  2.     During this period, our population vaccination rate has been going up by about one percentage-point each day. As of 5 August 2021, 67% of the population have completed their full vaccination regimen under the national vaccination programme and 78% have received at least one dose. Vaccination reduces the risk of infection and serious disease when infected with COVID-19. Over the last 28 days, among the 80 local cases infected with COVID-19 who are seriously ill [1], 72 are unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, while only 8 are fully vaccinated. A highly vaccinated resident population is crucial to our safe reopening and transition towards an endemic COVID-19 world.3.       We remain concerned that unvaccinated seniors may suffer severe illness if infected. Hence, we have ramped up efforts to encourage more seniors to be vaccinated. Seniors can walk into any vaccination centre, polyclinic, or Public Health Preparedness Clinic for their vaccinations. We have also deployed mobile vaccination teams to locations where many seniors live and home vaccination teams for homebound individuals. In addition, we have roped in General Practitioners and Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners to persuade seniors to be vaccinated. Many of our seniors have responded to these initiatives. We are also asking polyclinics and public hospitals to bring forward the appointments of seniors who are contraindicated, so that they can receive earlier advice on whether they can receive COVID-19 vaccinations. Currently, 76% of those aged 70 and above have completed two doses and 82% have received at least one dose. But there are still about 80,000 in this group that have yet to be vaccinated. As this group is at higher risk of being infected and being seriously ill if infected, we will continue efforts to help them get their vaccinations.4.       By 9 August 2021, we expect that around 70% of our entire population would have completed two doses. This gives us some confidence that we can start to re-open our economy and resume more activities. However, we will continue to take a calibrated risk-based approach in re-opening. We will monitor health outcomes, particularly hospitalisation and ICU cases, to avoid exponential increases that could overwhelm our healthcare capacity.5.       In particular, we will adopt a vaccination-differentiated approach when adjusting our safe management and border measures. Fully vaccinated individuals, who have good protection against the risk of infection or severe illnesses, will be able to engage in a wider range of activities. Unvaccinated individuals will need to exercise tighter safe management measures to protect themselves and those around them.6.       Even with high vaccination coverage, we may still have vaccine breakthroughs and a large number of daily COVID-19 cases within the community. Nevertheless, with the majority of our population protected through vaccination, we should be able to keep hospitalisation and ICU cases low. We will continue to monitor the situation, especially the incidence of severe illness from COVID-19, as we continue with our re-opening plans.Updates in Healthcare Protocols.7.       As we prepare for the transition towards COVID resilience, we have reviewed our medical management protocols for our COVID-19 patients. With evidence emerging that vaccinated individuals can recover within 10 days from illness onset, we have moved to discharge fully vaccinated persons earlier at Day 10 from isolation if their PCR test shows that they are COVID-19 negative or have very low viral loads. Others who do not meet the criteria will continue to be discharged after 14 days of isolation without any further testing, with an additional 7 days’ leave of absence. This approach gives us assurance that cases will not pose transmission risks to their family and community upon discharge.Updates to Safe Management Measures from 10 August 20218.       We have also undertaken a mid-point review of the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) measures, and will allow some easing of the measures in two steps. The first will take effect from 10 August 2021, and the second from 19 August 2021, if conditions remain stable. Please refer to Annex A for details.(A)  Increase in Social Gathering Group Size9.        We will increase the current social gathering group size limit from 2 persons to 5 persons and increase the cap of 2 distinct visitors per household per day to 5 distinct visitors per household per day. Unvaccinated individuals should remain in groups of no more than 2 persons, to reduce the likelihood of transmission and severe infection. We should also continue to limit our social circle to a small group of regular contacts and limit the number of social gatherings to no more than two a day.(B) Updates on Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures and Eligibility 10.     With better protection against infection and severe illness, fully-vaccinated individuals may participate, in groups of up to 5 persons, in higher-risk activities where masks are removed, e.g. Food & Beverage (F&B) dine-in, personal care services, indoor high-intensity mask-off sports; and in larger events e.g. solemnizations, congregational and other worship services.11.      With higher vaccination coverage under our national vaccination programme, we can take a more inclusive approach in recognising COVID-19 vaccines in the World Health Organisation’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL). From 10 August 2021, individuals who are fully vaccinated with the WHO EUL vaccines such as Sinovac-CoronaVac, Sinopharm, and AstraZeneca will be eligible for the vaccination-differentiated safe management measures.Thus, an individual will be considered “fully-vaccinated” two weeks after he or she has received the full regimen of Pfizer-BioNTech/ Comirnaty, Moderna, or any WHO EUL vaccines.12.      Unvaccinated individuals with a valid negative pre-event test result or recovered individuals are of similarly lower risk, and may also join in such groups of up to 5.Resumption of Dining-in at F&B Establishments for Vaccinated Groups13.     Groups of up to 5 persons will be allowed to dine-in at F&B establishments if all the diners are fully vaccinated. Unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below may be included within the group of 5 persons as long as all the children are from the same household.14.    Individual F&B establishments may only resume dine-in services for fully vaccinated persons as outlined above. F&B establishments that are not able to ensure this may only operate take-away and delivery services.15.   Hawker centres and coffee shops provide convenient and affordable food services within the community. As these are open-air and naturally ventilated spaces, we will extend a special concession for both vaccinated and unvaccinated persons to dine in the hawker centres and coffee shops. But this will be subject to a smaller group size of up to 2 persons only.16.   Dining-in at F&B establishments remains a high-risk activity because many people will be unmasked and in close proximity with each other. At this stage of the transition, entertainment such as live performances, recorded music, and videos/TV screening will continue to be prohibited. Patrons to F&B establishments are also reminded to adhere to all safe management measures and keep their masks on at all times except when eating or drinking.(C)  Increase in Event Size and Capacity Limits17.   The following event sizes and capacity limits will be increased. The provision for children aged 12 years and below will also apply for these events. Unvaccinated children may be included in a group of up to 5 persons if all the children are from the same household.a)     Congregational and other worship services, cinemas, MICE, live performances, and spectator sport events. Event sizes may increase to 500 attendees if all are fully vaccinated. Otherwise, only up to 50 attendees will be allowed without pre-event testing (PET). Unmasking and singing or playing of wind instruments at live performances for vaccinated performers may resume, subject to updated safe management measures. Further details on live performances will be released by the National Arts Council (NAC). Further details on worship services will be released by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY).b)     Marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions. Marriage solemnizations in external venues (i.e. not in a place of residence or in the Registry of Marriages/Registry of Muslim Marriages building) may take place with up to 500 persons (including the wedding couple but excluding solemnizers and vendors) if all are fully vaccinated. Otherwise, only up to 50 attendees will be allowed without PET. Wedding receptions will be allowed with up to 250 attendees if all are fully vaccinated, and with groups of up to 5 attendees per table.Adjustments from 19 August 202118.    If the COVID-19 situation remains under control, we will further increase event sizes and capacity limits for the following activities and settings from 19 August 2021:a)   Congregational and other worship services, cinemas, MICE, live performances, spectator sport events, and marriage solemnizations. These events may take place with up to 1,000 attendees if all are fully vaccinated. Otherwise, only up to 50 attendees will be allowed without PET.b)    Attractions, cruises, museums, and public libraries. The operating capacity of attractions and cruises will be increased from the current capacity of 25% to 50%. Museums and public libraries will also be allowed to operate at an increased operating capacity of 50%.c)    Shopping malls and showrooms. The occupancy limits for shopping malls and showrooms will be increased from the current limit of 16 sqm per person of Gross Floor Area, to 10 sqm per person.19.    Work-from-home. We will also ease the work-from-home requirements. In particular up to 50% of employees who are able to work from home will be allowed to return to the workplace.Removal of Temperature Screening Requirement20.    With high levels of vaccine coverage among our population, transmission among vaccinated individuals and disease severity in vaccinated but infected persons are likely to be substantially lower. In addition, we now have the ability to pick up infections earlier through increased surveillance measures including self-test antigen rapid test (ART) kits and rostered routine testing with fast and easy tests (FETs) in higher risk settings. With these other targeted public health tools, we will remove the requirement for temperature screening in public premises, together with the other relaxation of measures planned from 19 August 2021 onwards. Nevertheless, it is important to continue exercising good health-seeking behaviour when one is unwell by seeking care as soon as possible, using a mask and avoiding crowded places.Transition towards COVID-19 Resilience21.    Looking ahead, when at least 80% of our population have received their full vaccination regimens, we will be able to take the next steps towards opening up our economy, social activities, and travel. At that stage, we can consider further easing of restrictions, while continuing with differentiated safe distancing rules for vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. We will make these moves in a controlled manner, synchronising the easing with our vaccination coverage, and seeking to minimise the incidence of severe illness and death.“Vaccinate or Regular Test” Regime for Selected Sectors of the Workforce 22.      Although Singapore’s vaccination rates are one of the highest in the world, we need to continue to expand our vaccine coverage. Hence we will require vaccination, or regular testing in lieu, for selected sectors of the workforce. Unvaccinated persons will be required to undergo regular testing to pick up possible infections early so that they can be treated early. This will also mitigate risk of transmission to their colleagues and the public.23.     This “vaccinate or regular test” regime will be introduced in the following settings:a)     First for those working in the healthcare sector, eldercare sector and settings with children 12 years and below. This protects vulnerable segments of the population such as the elderly, children and sick.b)     Second, for individuals working in sectors that interact with customers in higher-risk mask-off settings, and at our borders or COVID-19 frontline work. These sectors include F&B establishments, gyms and fitness studios, and personal care services.c)     Finally, the Public Service will take the lead in introducing this requirement for public officers, including the uniformed services.24.    We will give some time for individuals to get vaccinated, thus the requirement will take effect from 1 October 2021. Beyond that, any unvaccinated persons from the above sectors will have to be tested with an ART kit twice a week. For the small group that remains medically ineligible for vaccines, the Government will subsidise their tests.25.   More details will be released by the respective Ministries overseeing the sectors. We strongly encourage all employers to facilitate vaccination for your employees. A fully vaccinated workforce ensures a safe workplace and safe environment for everyone. We will continue to closely monitor our vaccination rates and review the need to include other sectors in the future.Vaccination-Differentiated Border Measures26.   As we have reached higher vaccination rates locally, we will progressively review some of our border restrictions to facilitate more travel and introduce vaccination-differentiated border measures for travellers from countries/regions that have shown an ability to control the pandemic and vaccinate large parts of their population.Resuming Entry Approvals for Vaccinated Work Pass Holders and Their Dependants27.   From 10 August 2021, the Ministry of Manpower will resume entry approvals for work pass holders and their dependants with travel history to higher risk countries/ regions. Eligible work pass holders and their dependants must be fully vaccinated2 before arrival in Singapore. They will also be subjected to the prevailing health protocols in Singapore.Option for 14-day Stay Home Notice (SHN) at Suitable Place of Residence/ Accommodation of Choice28.   From 20 August 2021, 2359 hrs, all fully vaccinated travellers [2] from Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Italy, Norway, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and Switzerland [3] may be able to apply to opt out of dedicated SHN facilities and serve their 14-day SHN at their respective places of residence (e.g. residential address) or other suitable accommodation if they fulfil certain criteria (See Annex B for details).29.   All other travellers from the aforementioned countries/regions must continue to serve the SHN in a dedicated SHN facility. As the list of countries will be updated from time to time depending on the public health risk assessment, all travellers are reminded to check the SafeTravel website for updates to the border measures. They will be subjected to these prevailing border measures upon entry, including stays in dedicated SHN facilities and payment, where applicable.Towards a Resilient Singapore living with COVID-19 30.   We have made significant progress in vaccinating the Singapore population. We must continue to push for higher vaccination coverage so that in time to come, we may be able to treat COVID-19 no differently from other diseases that are endemic to Singapore. It will then not dominate our lives but become part of our new normal. We may continue to see relatively high number of daily cases, but the majority of vaccinated individuals will recover, and we can focus on the smaller number of cases with severe illnesses or infections. We will continue to find means to manage any new or emerging variants, and review strategies such as vaccination boosters for the population. We thank Singaporeans for your cooperation in these efforts. We must continue to work together in this journey towards a COVID-19 resilient nation.   MINISTRY OF HEALTH6 AUGUST 2021     [1] This refers to requiring oxygen supplementation, admission to ICU, or having passed away.

I am delighted to be with everyone here at the Singapore Congress of Radiology and Workshops in Interventional Radiology Education Singapore 2021. This year, the Congress will be held in conjunction with the 8th Asian Congress of Abdominal Radiology.2      After postponement in 2020 due to the pandemic, the congress is now back in its first ever fully virtual format. I am pleased to welcome the invited speakers and key opinion leaders, together with more than 800 local and regional participants. I am heartened that all of you have taken time out of your busy schedules to learn and exchange knowledge.3      Radiology is one of the central nodes of any healthcare system. The way the radiology community has risen to meet the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic truly embodies the theme for this year: “Support and Grow our Community in Radiology”.4      During the pandemic, timely and accurate interpretation of radiographs plays a vital front-line role in the diagnosis, grading and triaging of patients before their COVID-19 PCR test results are confirmed. At the start, the radiology community had to swiftly redesign their processes to manage the increased workload. This was on top of having to do minimally invasive image guided procedures in full PPE on isolated COVID-19 patients. These factors made it very challenging for radiologists. But nonetheless, the community persevered and made several breakthroughs in the process.5      For example, drawing from their experience at the Singapore Expo Community Care Facility, a SingHealth team from the Department of Radiology published the first large study proving that baseline chest radiographs are not needed in COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Such knowledge would reduce patient’s exposure to unnecessary radiation, help promote judicious use of imaging and prioritise resources for sicker and more symptomatic patients.6      The pandemic has fast-tracked innovation and redefined how we will run our operations in the future. Our radiology colleagues at Tan Tock Seng Hospital and their collaborators from the Agency of Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), designed and tested an artificial intelligence tool, RadiLogic. This tool can interpret abnormal chest X-ray findings and up triage these studies to be reported ahead of others. The uptriaging of X-rays will allow for quicker identification of sicker patients, thereby reducing morbidity. Deservingly so, this AI tool was awarded the Best Practice Medal in Automation, IT & Robotics Innovation, at the recent National Healthcare Innovation and Productivity Awards. Such drive and ingenuity gives me full faith that our healthcare family will continue to pioneer new technologies to seek out solutions to challenges in healthcare.7      While the present effects of the pandemic are manifold, its impact will continue to be profound when we enter a new post-COVID era. Our ageing population presents further challenges with the increase in demand for healthcare, and consequently, more imaging needs. I believe that our radiology community will continue to be leaders in innovation, striving for medical excellence and ensuring value-driven healthcare.8      Continuing with the theme of support and growth, the College of Radiologists will be celebrating Women in Radiology. This lecture brings together successful, renowned female radiologists from Singapore and abroad. Together, they will cover topics such as career-building, education, innovation and even showcase peculiar and serendipitous clinical cases.  We hope that their collective experiences can inspire the next generation of radiologists, women and men. I would also like to take this opportunity to congratulate Associate Professor Ong Chiou Li, senior consultant at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH), who will be presenting the prestigious FY Khoo memorial lecture. Professor Ong is a well-respected radiology leader in Singapore and was pivotal in setting up the Radiology department for the then newly restructured KKH. She served two terms as the Head of the Radiology department spanning 17 years. By the end of her term, KKH had amassed 18 Ultrasound units, a CT scanner, 2 MRIs and CT cum gamma camera along with a breast imaging unit. The multiple awards under her name are evidence of her commitment towards growth and education. She will be the first local female radiologist to be conferred this honour. Congratulations, Professor Ong.9      On this note, I would like to commend the Singapore Radiological Society, the College of Radiologists, Singapore and the Asian Society of Abdominal Radiology for their dedication in organising this conference. I wish everyone an informative and fruitful congress.Thank you very much.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-dr-koh-poh-koon-senior-minister-of-state-ministry-of-health-at-the-opening-ceremony-of-the-singapore-congress-of-radiology-workshops-in-interventional-radiology-education-13-august-2021,

He is making good progress and can perform his activities of daily living without assistance. He will likely be discharged in the coming weeks, but will likely require outpatient rehabilitation for some time before he can return to school and resume other activities. The medical team will continue his treatment and monitor his condition. 2.     Medical investigations have found that the youth had developed acute severe myocarditis which led to the out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. The myocarditis was likely a serious adverse event arising from the COVID-19 vaccine he received, which might have been aggravated by his strenuous lifting of weights and his high consumption of caffeine through energy drinks and supplements. 3.    Under the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme (VIFAP) provided by the Ministry of Health (MOH), a one-time financial assistance of $225,000 has been extended to the youth and his family. The independent clinical panel appointed to assess and adjudicate the VIFAP application found that while he has made good improvement, because his condition was severe and critical, he will require treatment and rehabilitation for some time yet to continue his recovery. Continue to avoid strenuous physical activity for one week after each dose 4.     While there is a small increased risk of myocarditis or pericarditis following the administration of the vaccines, the local incidence rate remains low at 0.48 per 100,000 doses administered, based on ongoing pharmacovigilance monitoring by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA). The majority have responded well to treatment and have recovered or been discharged well from the hospital. 5.     As a precaution, all vaccine recipients, especially adolescents and younger men, should avoid strenuous physical activity for one week following each of their first and second doses of the vaccine. Individuals should also seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeats. Individuals who developed myocarditis from their first dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines should also not receive further doses of it. 6.     Vaccination using the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR)-authorised mRNA COVID-19 vaccines deployed in our National Vaccination Programme (NVP) thus continues to be recommended for all eligible persons, including adolescents and younger men, as the protective benefits from the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines continue to outweigh the risks of vaccination. 7.     MOH, the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination and HSA will continue to monitor vaccine-related serious adverse events closely.  MINISTRY OF HEALTH16 AUGUST 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/positive-progress-for-16-year-old-who-had-an-out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest-after-covid-19-vaccination,

Amongst its findings, the CoMWT has identified three key issues that require a whole-of-government (WOG) approach to address. Moving forward, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will act on the CoMWT’s recommendations and enlarge the Taskforce into an inter-agency platform to oversee the development of a national overarching mental health and well-being strategy. Named the Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being, the platform will also coordinate interagency efforts and monitor outcomes, focusing on cross-cutting issues that require multi- and inter-agency collaboration. The new platform will be chaired by Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Health, Dr Janil Puthucheary.3. COVID-19 has brought unprecedented shifts into our lives. The fear of infection, changes in our daily routine and social isolation brought about by safe management measures, as well as economic uncertainty, are stressors that have impacted the mental well-being of many individuals. A number of local statistics and studies have described the significant impact of COVID-19 on the mental well-being of different segments of the Singapore population.i. Impact on General Population4. In an in-depth study conducted by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) to assess the Singapore population’s psychological responses and mental well-being during the pandemic, about 13% of the surveyed population reported experiencing symptoms of depression or anxiety in the period from May 2020 to June 2021.ii. Impact on Youth5. Between April and December 2020, the National Youth Council (NYC) conducted regular polls on Singaporean youths’ challenges and sentiments on COVID-19. Mental well-being was a challenge for over half of the youth population (52%) polled during the second half of 2020. 6. The top stressors cited by youth were anxiety over the future (53%), stress over finances (41%), and worries about academic or work performance (39%). These findings highlighted the importance of identifying ways to support our youth through the pandemic, such as strengthening their ability to cope with anxiety and uncertainty, promoting help-seeking behaviours and peer support efforts, and provide assurances about education prospects and career support.iii. Impact on Older Adults 7. Based on the findings of a Singapore Life Panel study by the Singapore Management University Centre for Research on Successful Ageing (ROSA)1 which assessed the attitudes, behaviours and well-being of older Singaporeans during  COVID-19, respondents reported a stark increase in feelings of isolation as the Circuit Breaker began in April 2020, with larger increases for those living alone. Research has shown that social isolation is often associated with negative mental health outcomes. It thus recommended for social and mental well-being efforts to be strengthened and more targeted at those who live alone.iv. Increased Utilisation of Mental Health Services8. The Institute of Mental Health (IMH) Mental Health Helpline saw 50% more callers in 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, with a peak seen in April 2020 which coincided with the start of the Circuit Breaker. Towards the end of 2020, the number of calls gradually decreased to 2019 levels, although it subsequently increased again between January and May 2021. Some of the initial concerns cited by callers included anxiety from having to adjust to working from home or home-based learning and being socially isolated, although less of such concerns were cited following June 2020. Concerns which persisted included friction with family members and concerns over job insecurity. 9. The National CARE Hotline (NCH) was launched in April 2020 to provide support to those facing mental health concerns such as anxiety and adjustment issues related to COVID-19.  As of end  May 2021, the hotline handled over 45,000 calls. The top three concerns cited by callers to the NCH pertained to the need of emotional support, mental health related issues and family-related or social matters.10. Efforts by mental health teams, the community as well as agencies and organisations across various sectors to address the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 have culminated in the introduction or ramp-up of over 40 initiatives, which can be categorised into the following three broad categories: a) Upstream initiatives to promote mental well-being and prevent the development of mental health conditions. This applies to the general population and specifically, parents and families; children and youth; workplaces and working population; and seniors.b) Downstream initiatives to facilitate the early detection, treatment and support of those at-risk of or with mental health needs. c) Other COVID-19 initiatives to address stressors which can impact mental well-being, e.g. SGUnited Jobs and Skills Package, COVID-19 Recovery Grant.11. The Taskforce has also identified three key issues to address. a) Need for Overarching Whole-of-Government Strategy: Currently, a range of agencies play different roles in the mental health and well-being landscape. We need to build an overarching strategy to guide the alignment and track progress of efforts across the different agencies. b) Need for Better Signposting Given Wealth of Resources: There are numerous online resources on mental health and well-being and this can be confusing and overwhelming for those who are searching for information. Engagement sessions with members of the Youth Mental Well-being Network2 revealed that there are also concerns with the currency, legitimacy and credibility of the information found on these numerous online resources. c) Better Alignment of Mental Health Training Resources and More Trained Mental Health Professionals: Multiple agencies conduct mental health training for different target groups in the community, including the general public, frontline officers, and mental health professionals. As such, there is a need to review and standardise the various training curriculum. We need to establish a common set of training standards, support the training of different providers  to achieve the requisite competency levels, and ensure that the trainings achieve the intended training goals and outcomes.  KEY RECOMMENDATIONSi. Develop an Overarching Strategy on Mental Health and Well-being strategy12. The Taskforce recommends the development of a National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy, which will provide overarching WOG goals and strategies to improve mental health and well-being for the population, as well as guide and align the various agencies’ individual efforts. The Government will engage the public on the development of this strategy through a public consultation to be carried out next year. ii. Develop a One-stop Online Portal for National Mental Health Resources 13. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) is developing a national portal for mental health and well-being content which will be curated by experts and target individuals who want to find information for themselves or their loved ones. HPB has started work on this with relevant agencies to develop the one-stop portal on HealthHub. HPB is planning to roll out the pilot version of the portal in the later part of this year. iii. Develop a National Mental Health Competency Training Framework 14. The Taskforce recommends setting up a national mental health competency framework, with a common set of training standards and clearly defined degrees of competencies expected of professionals and para-professionals who support persons with mental health conditions. The agencies which provide mental health training to community members have begun work to map out their mental health training programmes according to the proposed framework. INTERAGENCY TASKFORCE ON MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEING15. To move beyond providing mental health support for the population from COVID-19, MOH and the Ministry of Social and Family Development have set up the new Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being, which will oversee mental health and well-being efforts, focusing on cross-cutting issues that require interagency collaborations. The new platform will be chaired by SMS Janil Puthucheary and will include overseeing the implementation of the three recommendations from the CoMWT. This platform will also track the progress of implementation and impact of the Strategy at the national level. Please refer to Annex for the list of Taskforce members. [1] Straughan, PT et al.

I am honoured to join you at the 6th Singapore Mental Health Conference. I thank the IMH, AIC, NCSS and HPB team for organising this year’s conference – putting together a strong programme line-up, which I am confident will greatly enrich our participants.2.      In my address, I hope to set out the context for the rest of the conference, by speaking about three things. First, how COVID-19 has impacted mental health. Second, how we have responded. And, third, looking ahead and what it means for us. Let me begin.THE IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON MENTAL HEALTH3.      Humans are Social Creatures by nature; or Social animals, as what the famous Social Psychologist Elliot Aronson described in his landmark book of the same title in 1972. While we may have our individual personality differences, ranging one end of the extraversion scale to the other, humans share a core trait of wanting to feel belonged, and being part of a community. We treasure our daily social interactions. From our loved ones and friends, neighbourhood stallholders whom we frequent, to acquaintances and familiar faces whom we recognise in our community.4.      When COVID-19 struck, physical social interactions like these were largely put to a halt. Especially at its peak when safe distancing measures were imposed. Countries, including Singapore, were left with few choices – all of which were tough and had difficult trade-offs. Because if they did not impose these measures, more lives would have been lost. One trade-off was the very real risk of social isolation, especially among the vulnerable. Such as our elderly, who would be at the mercy of this faceless virus, if they caught it. Compounded with increasing anxieties from catching the virus as well as financial stressors arising from disrupted livelihoods, these had knock-on effects to wellbeing.5.      In Singapore, IMH found that between May 2020 to June this year, about 13% of the general population reported experiencing depression or anxiety symptoms, during the one year since the pandemic started. While these findings may be preliminary, I think that anecdotally most of us may have seen or experienced this in one way or another. Whether it is among the clients whom we serve, the students we teach, our colleagues, or even within our circle of friends.6.      What was also concerning during the pandemic, was the loose ascribing of mental health conditions to persons who have knowingly flouted safe management measures. Their behaviour may or may not be mental health related. By correlating such acts with being mentally unwell, it does not only trivialize the matter, but also reveals a lack of awareness, threatening to deepen the stigma of mental health conditions further. We can certainly do more to raise mental health literacy.7.      The pandemic has also resulted in some experiencing a state of low mental well-being, and feelings of stagnation and emptiness. What some might call ‘languishing’ – a lack of motivation and focus; even though there are no mental health symptoms present. Think about it as the middle state – between being well and flourishing on one end and having a mental health condition at the other. It is not a trivial matter. Because languishing has been reported to be a risk factor for the development of mental health conditions. This is an issue of concern, fueled by the ongoing pandemic.OUR RESPONSE TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES8.      To this end, we have mounted a whole-of-society response to address the concerns and impact on mental health brought about by the pandemic.9.      At the broader planning level, we had convened an inter-agency COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce last October to enable us to take stock of the impact and how we have addressed it. But beyond the macro planning efforts that the taskforce is doing, I would like to share about three groups of initiatives that we have already started: to provide psychological support; to raise awareness; and to rally the community.10.      The first is the National CARE Hotline. We had quickly set it up last April to provide psychological first aid to anyone in Singapore who was affected by the stresses that COVID-19 brought along. It was very manpower intensive, as it ran 24/7. Hence, we made an urgent call for volunteers to assist with manning the lines. Many answered the call, across the public and people sectors. Some went beyond the call of duty, taking on multiple shifts, others volunteered for midnight and weekend shifts – all on top of their daily jobs! They have handled over 45,000 calls since it started. We are deeply grateful for their tremendous efforts, and the initiative of many of our other mental health partners who had stepped up during the crisis. I know that some of you are here today as well, and I would like to acknowledge your contributions.11.      Second, raising awareness at the population level. MCCY and HPB launched the ‘Brave the New’ campaign towards the end of last year, providing simple tips on self-care and supporting others who are emotionally distressed, riding on the ‘Beyond the Label’ campaign, which was first launched in 2018 by NCSS to rally the community to reduce the stigma of mental health conditions. 12.      Third, rallying the community together to come up with solutions, particularly for the young. The Government launched the Youth Mental Well-being Network last February, bringing together the wider society to ideate and work on ideas to improve the well-being of our youth. Over 1,500 individuals, ranging from all walks of life, responded. They are now working on over 20 projects looking at important areas, such as strengthening peer support, and increasing emotional resilience.13.      These initiatives are some of the many ways in which our society has responded to these new challenges. But we can do more and better. This brings me to my final point.LOOKING BEYOND THE IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF COVID-1914.      The pandemic will be with us for some time. We will have to continue to adapt the way we respond to it and how we go about our lives. More importantly, it underscores the need to adopt a long-term approach in addressing the psychological aspects of its impact. Therefore, I am glad that this year’s conference theme is about exploring ‘Future Paradigms of Mental Health’.15.      To succeed, we need to internalise the lessons learnt, not only in managing infectious diseases, but also in addressing the mental health needs of the population moving forward. This is one of the key reasons why we have evolved the COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce, which I mentioned earlier, to look at addressing the population’s mental health in the longer term, with a focus on cross-cutting issues across agency lines.16.      One promising area is on harnessing the use of technology, such as Telehealth. We have already started doing so. One example is mindline.sg, which the MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation has rolled out. It aims to be a one-stop repository of resources and tools to improve mental well-being. You can even find a clinically validated self-assessment tool that one can use to conveniently understand their state of emotional well-being through answering a series of questions. The platform can also recommend appropriate intervention and support pathways based on their assessments.CLOSING17.      In closing, I would like to share an excerpt from a recent article published in The Atlantic by Professors Lara Aknin, Jamil Zaki and Elizabeth Dunn – members of an international Mental Health and Wellbeing Taskforce commissioned by The Lancet.18.      While they had described some of the toughest challenges faced by those financially affected by the pandemic and those with mental health conditions, they also offered a picture of hope and resilience that is within all of us. They said and I quote that, “as we look ahead to the world’s next great challenges – including a future pandemic – we need to remember this hard-won lesson: human beings are not passive victims of change but active stewards of our own well-being”. A timely reminder for us.19.      Let us work together, across all parts and levels of society, to actively steward the mental well-being and health of our nation. Because we cannot do this alone. May this conference be an opportunity for us to learn from the best and spark off new ideas on how we can do better and go further together. I am confident that this would put us in good stead to not only build up the resilience of individuals, but of our entire nation.20.      I wish all of you a fruitful and fulfilling time at the conference. Stay safe and stay strong. Thank you.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-masagos-zulkifli-2nd-minister-for-health-at-the-6th-singapore-mental-health-conference,

SGP,Asia,Singapore,10/9/2021,70612,573,343.143,58,1,0.429,12947.778,105.068,62.92,Updates to Healthcare Protocols and  Implementation of Vaccine Booster Strategy,"1.   The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) had earlier announced some measures to slow the spread of new cases, in response to the current infection wave that began on 23 August 2021. These give us time to encourage more unvaccinated seniors to get vaccinated, and roll out our vaccine booster programme.2.   This is the first time we are experiencing such an exponentially rising wave of infection in the community. Despite our high vaccination coverage, there is still a risk that the exponential cases can lead to more severe illnesses and deaths. The coming weeks will be a critical period as cases will continue to rise, and we will observe if infections translate to requirements for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds and deaths. We will also be rolling out the vaccine booster programme from 14 September to persons who are immunocompromised and seniors aged 60 years and above, to maintain the high level of vaccine protection. These are necessary steps to take as we continue our journey to re-open our society and community. We seek Singaporeans’ understanding and support during this period so that we can ensure as safe a re-opening as possible.3.   The most immediate task ahead is to reconfigure our healthcare protocols so that we can cope with the current level of infections. The large majority of infection amongst fully vaccinated persons have been mild or asymptomatic. The evidence also shows that fully vaccinated individuals recover faster and are well protected against serious illness. The Delta variant has also been shown to have a shorter incubation period than previous variants.  4.   Given this evidence, we will expand our home recovery pilot to allow more vaccinated individuals to recover at home, bring forward the discharge timeline for fully-vaccinated infection cases, and shorten the length of quarantine. This will allow us to better prioritise our healthcare capacity for treating serious cases, as well as for other healthcare needs.Updates on Local Situation5.   With the increase in community transmissions, we have intensified our testing programme to pick up cases early. With most residents respecting safe management measures (SMMs) in place, around 0.5% of the tests return positive, but nevertheless, the number of daily cases has been rising over the past fortnight, from an average of 76 cases per day a fortnight ago, to 288 cases per day in the past week. At the current trajectory, it is likely that we will soon reach more than 1,000 daily cases, detected early through intensified testing.6.   For now, the number of serious cases remains low – as of 9 September, there are 26 cases of serious illness requiring oxygen supplementation, and 7 in critical condition in the ICU. This is likely due to both our high vaccination rates, which stand at 81% fully vaccinated today, and the younger age profile of the infected. There continues to be strong evidence that vaccination is protective against severe illness. Among fully vaccinated cases in the past 28 days, 99.2% were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. Among unvaccinated and partially vaccinated individuals, 95.1% were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. Nevertheless, we are still early in this new wave of transmission and we need to continue to monitor the situation and remain vigilant.Updates to Healthcare Protocols7.   In line with the evidence that fully vaccinated individuals are mostly showing mild symptoms or are asymptomatic if infected, we started the Home Recovery Pilot on 30 August 2021, for fully vaccinated COVID-19 individuals infected with COVID-19 to recover from home, provided that they have a suitable home setting where they can be isolated from the rest of their household. Under the pilot, their household members must also be fully vaccinated and not belong to any vulnerable groups (such as the elderly or immunocompromised). These individuals will be equipped with care packs to monitor their symptoms and given access to 24/7 telemedicine support if they require any medical assistance.8.   21 individuals have been enrolled onto the pilot thus far and the results have been positive. Nine individuals have since been discharged as of 9 September, and the rest remain clinically well.9.   Given the encouraging pilot results, we will expand home recovery as the default care management protocol for more fully vaccinated individuals from 15 September 2021[1]. We will extend the scheme progressively to individuals up to 50 years-old who have no significant co-morbidities or underlying illnesses. This is because these individuals are generally well with no or mild symptoms and are able to self-care at home. Once notified of their COVID-19 positive results, these individuals should immediately self-isolate at home.10.   There have been a number of requests from parents to bring their infected children home as they are often well with no symptoms, and parents prefer to be able to take care of them at home. We have been careful and admitting children to hospitals to provide them with dedicated medical care. However, we will now allow and encourage parents to bring their infected children home, if they are at least 5 years-old and do not have co-morbidities or underlying illnesses. For these children, they will first be assessed by the hospital to be clinically fit for home recovery, before sending them back home for their recovery journey.11.   There is also evidence that vaccinated COVID-19 cases recover faster than unvaccinated cases. As such, since 7 September 2021, we have also shortened the length of isolation for fully vaccinated COVID-19 cases. These cases may be discharged as early as seven days into their illness if they have undetectable or very low viral loads, showing that they are non-infectious. Unvaccinated persons will continue to be discharged from 14 days into their illness.Updates to Quarantine Protocol12.   As the number of infection cases build up, we will prioritise our contact tracing resources on preventing large clusters at high-risk and vulnerable settings. We will rely more on TraceTogether data to identify close contacts of COVID-19 cases. Close contacts of a COVID-19 will be issued Health Risk Warnings (HRW) or Health Risk Alerts (HRA) and should get tested to minimise the risk of spread of disease. Household members of confirmed COVID-19 cases will also be required to quarantine themselves to further prevent risk of spread of disease. More information on the self-quarantine arrangement and the support which will be provided to these persons will be released later.13.   We will also adjust the quarantine period. The quarantine period is currently set at 14 days to account for the maximum COVID-19 incubation period. However, the Delta variant has a shorter incubation period – an average of under four days compared to an average of six days for the original strain. This means that it will take an average of four days after exposure to the virus, for the virus to be detectable in the individual. As such, we will reduce the quarantine period from 14 days to 10 days from the date of last exposure, provided the person under quarantine tests negative for COVID-19 at the end of his quarantine. He/she will need to continue to conduct daily ART after the quarantine period to Day 14 to mitigate any remaining risk of infection. This will be implemented from next week[2].14.   Overall, the shifts in our approach, including the use of HRW and HRA and self-quarantine, allow us to mitigate the risk of further transmission in a more sustainable manner. It requires more personal responsibility, and each of us to do our part.Commencing Vaccine Booster Programme15.   As announced on 3 September 2021, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be commencing the vaccine booster programme for two subgroups: (a) persons aged 60 years and above, as well as residents of aged care facilities and (b) persons who are moderately to severely immunocompromised.Seniors and Residents of Aged Care Facilities16.   From 14 September 2021, we will progressively invite seniors 60 years and above, and residents of aged-care facilities who have completed their vaccination regimen with two doses at least six months ago to receive their booster dose of a Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) mRNA vaccine. An SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the mobile number that they had registered with earlier for their first two doses, for them to book a new appointment on www.vaccine.gov.sg. Eligible residents of aged care facilities can also look forward to receiving their booster dose in the coming weeks.Immunocompromised Individuals17.   Individuals who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and have completed their two doses of the PSAR mRNA vaccines are encouraged to receive a third dose of the same PSAR mRNA vaccine two months after their second dose. However, they should consult their treating specialist, who would have the best understanding of their medical condition, prior to receiving their third dose. Eligible individuals may thereafter receive the vaccination in a hospital or Specialist Outpatient Clinic of their treating specialist, if these are offering vaccinations. Alternatively, they may obtain a referral form duly completed by their treating specialist, and subsequently walk into any Vaccination Centre for their third dose.Regular Testing18.  As announced on 6 September 2021, sectors currently on mandatory 14-day Fast and Easy Test (FET) Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) will need to increase their frequency of testing to every 7 days starting from 13 September 2021. New sectors with frequent interactions with the community would also be progressively onboarded onto 7-day FET RRT. Together, this intensified testing will improve our sentinel surveillance, allowing us to detect cases early and slow down the spread of the virus.19.   We also announced earlier that workplaces not on mandatory RRT should carry out regular testing for their onsite staff over a two-month period. We will begin to distribute the ART kits from next week onwards for companies to undertake this regular testing. More details on the application process, the coverage, and delivery of kits etc. will be provided soon. Beyond workplace testing, we encourage Singaporeans to use the ART kits that are currently being distributed to all households by 27 September 2021, to self-test yourselves before visiting crowded places, attending events or visiting vulnerable seniors. This will help us keep our community safe.Towards a COVID-19 Resilient Singapore20.   We urge everyone who has not been vaccinated to step forward now for your vaccination, and for those who are eligible for the booster programme to come forward when you are invited. This will allow us to maintain our high vaccination coverage and reduce the risk of serious illnesses or deaths. As we shift towards a COVID-19 resilient state, we will need everyone to play their part to see a doctor or stay home if feeling unwell, to self-test regularly and get a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test if self-tested to be positive, and to abide by the safe management measures. Together, we will be able to progress along our journey towards being a COVID-19 resilient nation.MINISTRY OF HEALTH10 SEPTEMBER 2021[1] These changes will not apply to dorm residents for now due to the larger risk of transmission given their cohorted living arrangements.[2] These changes will also not apply to dormitory residents for now due to the larger risk of transmission given their cohorted living arrangements.

For Singaporeans with family and work commitments abroad, this makes it difficult for them to return to Singapore for vaccination given the long duration away from their resident countries.  3   Our present high local vaccination rates give us the foundation to introduce two vaccination channels for overseas Singaporeans (OS) arriving via Changi Airport and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal:             a.         Receive the first dose upon arrival in Singapore without serving full SHN, then return to their resident country on the next available flight/ferry. Individuals can complete their vaccination regimen by repeating this process for their second dose; or             b.         Receive the first dose upon arrival in Singapore, complete full SHN at a dedicated facility, and receive the second dose after the required dosing interval before returning to their resident country. 4   OS under Option (b) will be subject to the prevailing border measures on the pre-departure test, on-arrival testing regime as well as length of SHN based on their 21-day travel history. OS under Option (a) will also be subject to the same prevailing border measures until they depart on the next available flight/ferry. Regardless of their country/region of embarkation, the OS will be required to stay at an appointed dedicated facility where the vaccination will be offered on-site, while they are under SHN. For more information on the entry requirements to Singapore for returning Singaporeans, please visit the SafeTravel website. 5   While the COVID-19 vaccines will be provided by the Singapore Government, OS will have to bear the associated costs of returning for the vaccination, including accommodation at the designated facility, swab tests and travel expenses. 6   OS should register their interest in using either vaccination channel via https://go.gov.sg/vaccinationchannels. Prior to travelling to Singapore, OS should obtain the relevant re-entry approvals and return flight/ferry tickets to ensure they can return to their resident countries after their vaccination. More information on the vaccination channels can be found on MOH’s FAQ page.  MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRSMINISTRY OF HEALTH SINGAPORE 11 September 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/covid-19-vaccination-channels-for-overseas-singaporeans_11Sep2021,

With the number of cases expected to continue to rise in the coming weeks, we need to take further action to protect the vulnerable seniors in these settings. 3.     As an enhanced measure to reduce the spread of COVID-19 in residential care homes, all in-person visits to residential care homes will be suspended from 13 September 2021 to 11 October 2021 (both dates inclusive). This temporary suspension of visitation will give us time to encourage more unvaccinated seniors to get vaccinated, and roll out the vaccine booster programme for residents of aged care facilities, details of which were announced by MOH on 10 September 2021. 4.     We will also be strengthening the testing regime for both staff and residents/clients of aged care facilities, and will use Antigen Rapid Tests (ART) more frequently, to complement the current surveillance testing in these settings.  5.     We urge the next-of-kin of unvaccinated seniors in the aged care facilities to support and encourage their loved ones to be vaccinated. Unvaccinated seniors may suffer severe illness if infected. It is also important for vaccinated seniors to receive the booster vaccination when it is made available, to ensure a continued high level of immunity and protection from severe disease. 6. We will observe the situation in the coming weeks and will review the suspension of visitation accordingly. We seek the understanding and cooperation of all Singaporeans as we make adjustments to protect our seniors. MINISTRY OF HEALTH12 SEPTEMBER 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/enhanced-measures-for-residential-care-homes,

We have had several clusters in the hospitals, have had to close wards, and subject patients and healthcare workers to testing and quarantine.Given the risk of infections brought in by visitors, from 19 August 2021 onwards, unvaccinated visitors to hospital wards will need to have a valid negative antigen rapid test (ART) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result obtained within the 24 hours prior to their visit. Fully vaccinated persons can also get infected and can shed the virus, but because they have a lower risk of spreading the infection, we will allow these vaccinated visitors to enter hospital wards without the need for a pre-visit COVID-19 test.All visits will be limited to 30 minutes. Each patient can register up to two visitors for each admission, with only one visitor at the patient’s bedside at any time. Patients who are very ill can register up to five visitors, with two visitors allowed at the patient’s bedside at any time. All visitors to the hospital must wear a high filtration efficiency face mask at all times. They must not eat or drink in the hospital wards. They must not use the patients’ toilets in the wards and they must avoid sitting on patients’ beds.As we transit into the endemic stages of COVID-19, MOH will monitor the exposure risks in our hospitals and adjust the hospital visitation policy accordingly.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/hospitalisation-visitation-guidelines-under-covid-19-endemic-model-and-whether-exceptions-can-be-made-for-patients-in-critical-condition,

The percentage of infected children who experience severe illness and require intensive care is 0.7% in Israel, 0.3% in the Republic of Korea and 0.6% in France. There is evidence suggesting that children with underlying medical conditions such as genetic, neurological, metabolic conditions, some degree of medical complexity, congenital heart disease, obesity, diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease, sickle cell disease, or immunosuppression might be at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19.Fortunately, in Singapore, no child thus far has developed severe illness requiring oxygen supplementation or ICU care. So the percentage of infected children that experience severe illness in Singapore is zero.  We are however mindful that the number of cases in the community is rising and there may be more children infected with COVID-19 in the future. We will ensure that these children receive appropriate care, if their illness is more severe.There are things parents can do to minimise the risk of their children getting infected for developing severe illnesses. All family members should maintain good hygiene and keep their home clean. When out, keep your masks on and cut back on social activities where masks are off or the interactions are prolonged, because such interactions account for the large majority of infections. When unwell, do a self-test or see a doctor immediately. These effective safe management and surveillance measures have been implemented to further keep our children safe, particularly in large settings where children congregate, such as preschools and schools. These include mask-wearing, limiting group size, personal hygiene and requiring those children with higher risk to take a leave of absence. Family members should also get vaccinated, to reduce the risks of being infected and transmitting COVID-19 to the child.Immunocompromised children are at risk from COVID-19 and other infectious diseases.  They and their family should exercise additional precautions such as avoiding crowded places and minimising the number of visitors.As for ‘Long COVID’, it is an informal term that refers to persons who have continued symptoms of COVID-19 infection. The underlying reasons for these symptoms vary, as do the symptoms themselves.  Locally, infected children generally have not had such prolonged symptoms. But we will offer care to all patients with ‘long COVID’ if this occurs, and especially those who require support from different clinical teams depending on their conditions.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/delta-variant-infections-and-long-covid-in-children,
SGP,Asia,Singapore,15/9/2021,73938,807,622.286,58,0,0.286,13557.65,147.976,114.105,"Speech by Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Health At the Asean-eu Health Summit, 15 September 2021","Mr Donald Kanak, Chairman, EU-ASEAN Business CouncilExcellenciesDistinguished GuestsLadies and Gentlemen1.     All health ministers today are seized with managing the ever-evolving COVID-19 situation, while still worrying about the significant challenges regarding the health of our populations and our healthcare systems.2.      However, as abruptly as we were thrusted into the COVID-19 storm, every country had to adapt quickly to battle the evolving virus. We rolled out vaccination, tested our population widely, imposed social distancing measures, contact traced and quarantined those exposed to the virus. It is a frantic period for all of us, but a lot of good has also come out of it, for we were forced to build up healthcare management capabilities in double quick time.3.      Throughout history, capabilities built up to respond to emergencies and crises proved to be enduring over time. Controlling floods in China helped build up central administrative capabilities. Earthquakes resulted in better building materials and methods.  Wars propelled the advancement of technology used largely for peaceful purposes now.4.       Likewise, the capabilities we acquired in fighting the COVID-19 crisis has long term relevance to our healthcare systems.  Today, I will share five such relevant capabilities:Wider Adoption of Vaccines5.       First, wider adoption of vaccines.  Many countries have rolled out nationwide vaccination programmes which were largely kept voluntary as they were approved under emergency use. Governments thus had to explain to their people how the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks, and that everyone needs to do their part to get vaccinated to overcome the pandemic. Many countries have achieved admirable COVID-19 vaccine coverage. In Singapore, 82% of the total population have taken both doses and 85% have taken the first dose.6.       Through this exercise, almost every child, adult and senior now know about vaccines and how they work. That there are different technology platforms; no vaccines are 100% protective but can make a big difference when it comes to saving our lives; it is the collective action of everyone coming forward for vaccination that helps to build up herd protection; and we should be alert to misinformation and falsehoods about vaccines.7.       Today, our children are well vaccinated against diseases Hepatitis B, BCG and MMR. However, vaccination rate for diseases like Influenza has been low.  Based on the 2019 National Population Health Survey, about 1 in 5 Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years reported taking an influenza vaccination in the past 24 months.8.       Partially due to the low take up of the influenza vaccine, we still have 600-800 deaths from influenza yearly in Singapore, which could have been prevented by Influenza vaccines.9.       I hope that post COVID-19, with greater awareness of the benefits of vaccination, our vaccination rates for the other infectious diseases will pick up as well. This will help us avoid more vaccine-preventable diseases and deaths. Primary and Community Care10.     Second, a stronger primary and community care system. During the COVID-19 crisis, when infection numbers climbed, every healthcare system instinctively want to protect its intensive care and hospital capacity for those who needs the medical attention the most. They therefore decant those with mild or no symptoms to recover at home or in community health facilities. In fact, for patients with mild symptoms, it is often better for them to be taken care of by community General Practitioners or family doctors, than by hospital staff.11.     A crisis like this brought out the importance of primary and community care as the first and most important line of defence. For example, we relied on Acute Respiratory Illness testing at the primary care level to identify COVID-19 cases early and initiate public health actions. This also allowed us to gauge the extent of community transmission. When it came to vaccinations, it was the primary care doctors who managed to persuade people who were hesitant, especially our seniors, to get vaccinated. Because they are not just doctors, but also trusted family friends.12.     As our population ages, the community care setting is key to our efforts to right-site healthcare. This is where we screen our population for chronic diseases, dispense medical advice to help people lead healthier lifestyles and take preventive measures. We want to avoid the hospitals, because by the time we need their services it is often too late. We should focus on health care and not sickness care, and the former must take place in the community, at the primary care level.Telemedicine13.      Third, COVID-19 presented an opportunity to make telemedicine an indispensable feature of our future healthcare system. 14.       Telemedicine is not new to Singapore. In 2018, we introduced a regulatory sandbox for telemedicine to gauge its acceptance, better understand the benefits and risks, as well as co-create solutions with the industry. However, like all new things that concerns our health, the take up has been patchy. 15.        COVID-19 has forced us to quickly scale up deployment of telemedicine operations to support the fight against COVID-19. This is especially when we are pushing for home recovery for COVID-19 patients who are fully vaccinated, young, healthy and have no or mild symptoms. Remember in Asia, our starting point was to follow the medical protocol for SARS, and all COVID-19 patients were warded instead of recovering from home. Switching to home recovery now requires a mindset shift and the provision of 24/7 telemedicine support allows us to provide greater reassurance to the patients.16.        The pandemic has therefore brought digital health technologies into the fore.  Post COVID-19, I hope there is greater acceptance and confidence with telemedicine, and healthcare can be made more accessible, and brought effectively to the comforts of one’s home.Better Personal Hygiene17.       Fourth, personal hygiene. In 2020 and 2021, the incidence of Influenza, other bacterial and viral infections have plunged. Hospitals are reporting record low hospitalisation due to such infections. I for one has not fallen ill since the beginning of last year.18.       This can be attributed to our population observing safe distancing, and importantly, wearing masks and practising good hygiene habits such as washing our hands more frequently. Singaporeans do not have the habit of wearing a mask when they are ill, but now everyone is wearing one. 19.        In our public hawker centres, we instituted a new rule for patrons to return their trays, something which we probably should have done earlier. In schools, we also instituted a new practice where students will clean up and sanitise the table after their meals in the canteen. Good habits need to be inculcated young, and the pandemic is a good time to for us to start the effort.20.        I hope all these can become permanent habits of Singaporeans. It will make us healthier and more resilient to diseases.   A Vaccines Supply Chain and Manufacturing Hub21.        Fifth, we now have an opportunity to develop Singapore into a vaccines supply chain and manufacturing hub.22.        Despite COVID-19, the Changi Airhub continues to serve as a node in the world, with a comprehensive network of connections. We have been investing in pharmaceutical cargo capabilities such as cold chain infrastructure. Today, Singapore serves as a COVID-19 vaccine distribution centre to regional countries, in Southeast Asia, Australia and New Zealand. 23.       Building upon our existing base of pharmaceutical manufacturing capabilities, we have further attracted investments from global pharmaceutical companies to manufacture vaccines in Singapore.24.      BioNTech has announced plans to establish its Regional HQ for South East Asia and a fully integrated mRNA manufacturing facility in Singapore around 2023.  The facility will supply a pipeline of mRNA-based products, and can rapidly respond to potential pandemic threats in the region.25.      Sanofi also announced its plan to invest EUR400 million to build a new vaccine production site in Singapore. It will be a regional centre of excellence with multiple vaccine manufacturing capabilities.26.       Lastly, Thermo Fisher Scientific announced that it would establish a new USD130 million Fill-and-Finish facility by 2022 to manufacture vaccines and therapeutics in Singapore.Pandemic Preparedness27.       Finally, COVID-19 has helped us become more prepared for future pandemics.28.       After SARS in 2003, we had a robust system to contact trace and isolate individuals exposed to the virus. We also decided to build a National Centre for Infectious Diseases with 330 beds in 17 isolation and cohort wards. 17 years later, these investments in capabilities and infrastructure have helped us immensely as we confront COVID-19 in 2020.29.       With COVID-19, we have again built up a whole new arsenal to deal with future pandemics. We are now able to roll-out a national vaccination programme for the whole population. We have a system of widespread testing and surveillance – more than 10,000 PCR tests per million population per day - to detect outbreaks. We have the knowhow to conduct phylogenetic studies and variant detection. 30.       We have an IT system leveraging Bluetooth technology, to elevate our contact tracing capability to the next level. We have put in place a multi-tier system of medical care, for infected individuals with varying degrees of illness severity.31.       Most importantly, we have a people hardened by the pandemic crisis, such that we know how to co-operate with each other and work in unison to overcome a major challenge like COVID-19.32.      These are important improvements to our pandemic preparedness for any future crisis. Singapore’s Position33.      The secretariat asked me if I could share Singapore’s model of responding to COVID-19. Today, Singapore finds itself in a rather unique position. We know that it is not possible for a global city state like us to eradicate the virus within our borders. Lockdowns inflict pain and suffering to many workers, families and businesses, especially the small and medium sized businesses.34.      We will need to open up social and economic activities progressively and safely. People in Singapore – from families, students, workers, executives, businessmen, entrepreneurs, researchers, scientists and leisure seekers - must be able to travel to other countries and back again without prolonged quarantine. 35.      We have therefore decided to embark on a journey to transit to a resilient nation that can live with COVID-19.  But the path we take will not be straight forward, but full of unexpected twists and turns. More importantly, Singapore is trail blazing a road that others have not trampled on. 36.      This is because we know that to live with COVID-19, there must come a time when we will have to ride through at least one big wave of transmission in the community.37.     Most countries, including many European countries, went through this the hard way and paid a huge price in human lives. Today, you have opened up and people go about their lives quite normally.38.      Singapore is in a middle of a big wave of transmission in our population, the difference is we are doing so only after vaccinating 80% of our population. So, we are riding this wave in a relatively naïve state, without natural antibodies but with vaccine-generated immunity. Currently, we are monitoring anxiously to see if vaccinations will prevent the rising number of infections from translating into many more severe illnesses and deaths. This will give us the confidence that we can live with Covid-19 safely.39.      This is where we stand currently: Over the past 23 days, which was when the current wave started, there were about 6,600 new infections detected, with seven admissions to ICUs and two deaths, predominantly accounted for by unvaccinated individuals. The next few weeks will be crucial.40.       So I am afraid I have no answers on what is the best battleplan against COVID-19.  I can only share that we are at a critical moment and the outcomes in the coming weeks will guide our next steps. We are in this current position, because of the unique approach that Singapore has taken to accelerate our vaccination programme and take calibrated steps to re-open our society and economy.41.      This is an outcome of medical science, as well as a people who are prepared to hold the fort against the virus until we feel we are sufficiently inoculated, and we are fortunate to be in the position to adopt this approach.Conclusion - A Common Baptism of Fire42.     COVID-19 does not recognize nationalities and is a common threat to humankind. Every country and people has been put through a stringent baptism of fire. 43.     In that process the world came together in many ways – sharing scientific discoveries, findings and knowhow in combating the virus, and linking up our supply chains to deliver test kits, medical equipment and vaccines. 44.      We are learning from each other.  For example, over the past 20 months, we witness the healthcare responses of European and Asian countries. For Europe, the starting point was closer to a response for an Influenza outbreak, where individuals rest at home and seek medical help when they are unwell. But that proved to be inadequate against a deadlier virus like COVID-19.45.     In Asia, the starting point was SARS, where every case was hospitalised, and his contacts identified and isolated to prevent further spread. But that provided to be unsustainable as COVID-19 is far more infectious and affects many more people.46.      Over time, European countries too started to conduct tracing and isolation, while Asian countries like Singapore are making home recovery the default for vaccinated individuals who are healthy with mild or no symptoms.47.      I also hope that as soon as we are ready, Europe and Asia can start to rebuild the bridges across our continents again. Singapore and the EU are in discussion on mutual recognition of health certificates, which will pave the way for us to reopen our borders to each other safely.48.       At ASEAN, member states have committed to the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework (ACRF) which was adopted at the 37th ASEAN Summit last November. It serves as the region’s coordinated exit strategy from the COVID-19 pandemic and reflects ASEAN’s commitment to build back better in a pragmatic and sustainable manner. 49.      The key initiatives include the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Reserve of Medical Supplies for Public Health Emergencies, the ASEAN Travel Corridor Arrangement Framework to revive essential business and official travel within ASEAN while prioritising public health and safety. 50.      May this spirit of co-operation stay strong, to help see all of us through this pandemic.

SGP,Asia,Singapore,16/9/2021,74848,910,687,59,1,0.286,13724.512,166.862,125.972,Expert Committee On Covid-19 Vaccination Statement On Skin Reactions After Vaccination and Refraining From Strenuous Physical Activity After Vaccination,"      The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V), having reviewed further vaccine safety data, has recommended the following:a.    Persons who developed delayed non-severe skin reactions and persons who had non-specific skin symptoms after receiving a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine may be suitable to receive subsequent doses of the same vaccine b.    Vaccinated persons, particularly adolescents and those of younger age, should avoid strenuous physical activity for two weeks after any dose of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccinesSkin Reactions that Develop After Vaccination2.    Persons with mild or non-specific skin reactions following the first dose of a mRNA COVID-19 vaccine were previously deemed ineligible for further vaccine doses of the vaccine. This has resulted in such persons being declined further doses.3.    In view of international evidence and accrued local experience around the safety of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, this has been reviewed. Persons who developed the following skin reactions to a previous dose of mRNA-based vaccine may now be able to receive a subsequent dose of the same vaccine:a.    Non-severe skin reactions occurring more than four hours after vaccination without other symptomsb.    Non-specific skin symptoms such as itching without a rash, a red patch beyond the injection site or eczemac.    Flares of underlying skin condition such as psoriasis and eczema4.    This will allow more persons, particularly those with minor or non-specific past reactions, to safely complete vaccination. Persons with the above conditions are encouraged to return to their previous vaccination sites in order to be reassessed for eligibility to complete their vaccination.Refraining from Strenuous Physical Activity for Two Weeks After Vaccination 5.    Local and overseas data continue to show a small risk of developing myocarditis or pericarditis after mRNA COVID-19 vaccination, occurring predominantly in younger persons and after dose 2. As per the fifth COVID-19 vaccine safety update released on 16 September 2021 by Health Sciences Authority (HSA), the overall local incidence after dose 2 was 1.06 per 100,000 doses administered, and the incidence rate in males below 30 years old after dose 2 was 4.84 per 100,000 doses administered. 6.    While most of the cases reported previously had occurred within one week of vaccination, HSA had also started to receive reports of some cases that occurred within the second week of vaccination. Myocarditis and pericarditis after vaccination are rare, but occurrence tends to be higher in young males aged 30 years and below. As a further precaution, vaccinated persons, in particular adolescents and younger persons, who have received any dose of the mRNA COVID19 vaccines, should be advised to avoid strenuous exercise or physical activity for two weeks after the vaccination, instead of one week which was previously recommended. During this time, they should seek medical attention promptly if they develop chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. Vaccination providers should advise this to individuals receiving the vaccine. 7.    Thus far, most local cases of vaccine-related myocarditis in the younger age group have been mild, responded well to treatment and are recovering or were discharged well from the hospital. This is consistent with what has been observed internationally. Conclusion8.    EC19V will continue to monitor the data and developments around COVID-19 vaccination and will update its recommendations as needed.EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION16 SEPTEMBER 2021 ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/expert-committee-on-covid-19-vaccination-statement-on-skin-reactions-after-vaccination-and-refraining-from-strenuous-physical-activity-after-vaccination,
SGP,Asia,Singapore,17/9/2021,75783,935,738.714,59,0,0.143,13895.959,171.446,135.454,Antigen Rapid Test Kits Vending Machines  Deployed Islandwide and  Updates to Home Recovery and Travel Classifications ,"    We have seen a continued rise in local COVID-19 cases. The great majority of these cases have exhibited no or mild symptoms. We will continue to calibrate our safe management measures, test extensively and contact trace as widely as possible to identify and reduce serious infections early. We will also make testing more pervasive by proliferating the use of Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits within our community and at our workplaces, and adjust our healthcare protocols to better navigate the current wave of transmissions.Local Situation Update2.   Even as our infection cases rise - the average number of cases increased from 146 cases per day a fortnight ago, to 682 cases per day in the past week – the number of serious cases, for now, remains low. As of 16 September, there are 77 cases requiring oxygen supplementation, and 12 in critical condition in the intensive care unit (ICU). They represent 1.6% and 0.1% of total infections over the last 28 days.  3.    This has largely been brought about by the vaccination programme, which has covered 82% of our residents to date. The occurrences of severe illnesses are not even, concentrating mostly on older and unvaccinated infected individuals.  (See Annex A.) Nevertheless, we are still early in this new wave of transmission and must continue to stay vigilant.4.    To this end, we will press on with our vaccination booster efforts,and will continue to proliferate pervasive testing in the community and at our workplaces. We will also review our healthcare protocols to identify opportunities to facilitate more home recovery and isolation, as part of our transition to a COVID-19 resilient nation.Vending Machines Deployed Islandwide to Support Distribution of ART Kits5.    The Ministry of Health (MOH) is deploying 100 vending machines across 56 locations islandwide.  The vending machines will be available for 24/7 access from 18 September 2021. More information on the Health Risk Warnings (HRW) and Health Risk Alerts (HRA), the full list of collection points and the steps for collection of the ART self-test kits is available at gowhere.gov.sg/art.6.    Individuals who receive an HRW SMS notification must get an entry polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test at a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic or Private Practitioner (PP)[1], and self-isolate until they receive a negative result from their first PCR test. They will also be required to perform self-administered ART tests on the third, fifth and seventh day from the day of last exposure to the COVID-19 case whom they were close contacts with, followed by another exit PCR test on or after the eighth day at a SASH clinic or PP. If all these are complied with, their HRW period will end on the tenth day of exposure. All swab costs will be borne by the Government.7.    From 18 September 2021 onwards, individuals who are informed of their HRW or HRA status by MOH through SMS will also receive instructions on the frequent testing regime that they must follow. To facilitate this, such individuals may scan their Singapore-issued ID (NRIC/FIN) to collect a pack (comprising three ART self-test kits) at a nearby vending machine, and use the ART kits for self-testing to fulfil the requirement for HRW. Please refer to Annex B for the list of locations for these vending machines.8.   From 18 September 2021, individuals who receive an HRA SMS notification should perform a self-administered ART test on the first, third and fifth day from the day of last exposure to the COVID-19 case whom they were potentially close contacts with, and monitor their health until the tenth day of exposure. All who have been issued a HRW or a HRA can use their government-distributed kits to perform the required self-administered ART tests. We urge all on HRA to exercise social responsibility and limit their interactions with other persons during that period.Expanding the Suitability of Home Recovery Individuals 9.   We have made Home Recovery the default care management model for suitable COVID-19 patients less than 50 years old from 15 September 2021. 597 fully vaccinated COVID-19 patients, including 13 children between 5 to 11 years old have successfully started their home recovery journey. This is close to a third of the community cases for the past two days, which is highly encouraging, as we see more individuals taking personal empowerment to take care of their own health and recovery. Since the pilot started from 30 August 2021, 32 of them have been discharged. 10.  Data continues to show that fully vaccinated individuals are indeed less at risk of severe illness, especially those under the age of 70 years. Hence, we will be further expanding the suitability criteria for Home Recovery to now include fully vaccinated individuals up to the age of 69 years. This allows more COVID-19 patients to recover within the comfort of their homes, and for us to further direct our hospitals resources to those who really need more intensive care. 11.   From 18 September 2021, Home Recovery will be the default care management model for individuals who are:a.  Fully vaccinated;b.  Aged 12 to 69 years old;c.  No severe co-morbidities or illnesses; d.  Able to self-isolate in a room, preferably with an attached bathroom; ande.  Have no household members who are more than 80 years old or are in one of the vulnerable groups (e.g. pregnant individuals or with weakened immune response).12.   Individuals tested positive for COVID-19 and meet the above criteria can begin Home Recovery immediately, without having to be conveyed to a hospital or Community Care Facility. We continue to urge all fully vaccinated COVID-19 individuals below the age of 70 to adopt Home Recovery as the default care management, just like how you would recover from, say, Influenza. Please continue to self-isolate from your household members until you receive confirmation of your PCR test results. If you are confirmed COVID-19 positive, please refer to the 10-step guide on our Home Recovery website at go.gov.sg/home-recovery.Updates to Travel Classifications in our Calibrated Measures at our Borders 13.   The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has also been closely monitoring the global COVID-19 situation and continues to update the country risk classification periodically.  The updated classification, together with the associated testing requirements, can be found in Annex C.a.  Category II: This would include countries/regions such as Australia, Brunei, Canada, Germany, New Zealand and the Republic of Korea today. We have reviewed the COVID-19 situation in Poland and Saudi Arabia and will also add them to this category from 22 September 2021, 2359 hours.b.  Category III: We have reviewed the COVID-19 situation in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, Latvia, Portugal and Spain and will add them to this category from 22 September 2021, 2359 hours.  Vaccinated travellers from these countries may apply to serve their 14-day Stay-Home Notice (SHN) at a suitable accommodation of their choice (e.g. residential address, hotels or serviced apartments), if they fulfil the criteria listed in Annex D. Unvaccinated travellers will still be required to undergo a 14-day SHN at dedicated SHN facilities.Resumption of Transits and Removal of On-arrival ART for Travellers from Indonesia 14.   We had previously announced that all travellers with a 21-day travel history to Indonesia would not be allowed to transit through Singapore, and those entering Singapore would also be required to undergo an on-arrival ART (on top of the on-arrival PCR test). As the situation in Indonesia has shown improvement, all passengers with travel history to Indonesia within the last 21 days prior to departure for Singapore will be allowed to transit through Singapore from 22 September 2021, 2359 hours. In addition, travellers from Indonesia entering Singapore will be required to undergo an on-arrival PCR test[2] instead of an ART[3] plus a PCR test.  Travellers with travel history to Indonesia within the last 21 days prior to departure for Singapore will be subject to Category IV border measures.15.   As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID-19 resilient nation. Any changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures for the associated country or region before entering Singapore; and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry.Working together towards COVID-19 resiliency16.   Our current transmission levels are in line with those experienced by similar countries on a path towards COVID-19 resilience. While our vaccinations have allowed us to keep severe illness low among those who are infected, we need all Singaporeans to remain vigilant and continue working together by exercising civic consciousness and personal responsibility so that we can dampen the rate of transmission together and ride this wave of infections safely. To this end, we seek everyone’s continued cooperation to come forward for vaccination if you have not yet done so, seek medical care if feeling unwell, practise good hand hygiene, self-test regularly, and self-regulate social interactions at a restrained level. Together, we will emerge stronger.MINISTRY OF HEALTH17 SEPTEMBER 2021[1] PCR tests can be taken at the following PPs: Fullerton Health Testing Centre, Raffles Hospital or Kingsway Medical Clinic. Individuals on HRW may make an appointment through the booking link: go.gov.sg/hrw-testing[2] To expedite the COVID-19 PCR test at the checkpoints, travellers are strongly encouraged to register and pre-pay for their on-arrival COVID-19 PCR test prior to departing for Singapore at https://safetravel.changiairport.com/ (for Changi Airport) and https://t.2c2p.com/express/parkwayshenton (for Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal).[3]  Travellers from Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, the Philippines and Sri Lanka would also undergo an on-arrival PCR instead of an ART plus a PCR test.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/antigen-rapid-test-kits-vending-machines-deployed-islandwide-and-updates-to-home-recovery-and-travel-classifications_17Sep2021,

Of those who have fallen very ill, 100 are seniors above 60 years.   2.  Case 78675, a 90 year-old male Singaporean, has passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection on 17 September 2021. He had been conveyed to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases on 17 September with symptoms, and tested positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day. He had not been vaccinated against COVID-19, and had a history of cancer, heart disease and pneumonia. In total, 60 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection. 3.   Some of our public hospitals have been experiencing a surge in the number of patients who have rushed to their A&E departments with mild acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms. We urge those who have mild symptoms to avoid seeking treatment at the hospitals and instead consult a General Practitioner (GP) at a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic instead. The SASH GPs are capable of assessing the severity of their symptoms and perform COVID-19 diagnostic tests when needed to confirm their status. This allows those with more severe illnesses and who are in need of urgent care to be attended to quickly and helps to preserve hospital capacity for those who truly need hospital care. Figure 1: Number of Active Cases in ICU or Requiring Oxygen Supplementation14.  Over the last 28 days, the percentage of local cases who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms is 98.1%. 177 cases required oxygen supplementation, 18 had been in the ICU, and 4 died, of whom none was fully vaccinated2. Figure 2: Local Cases in the Last 28 Days by Severity of Condition3  Figure 3: Deaths and Active Cases in ICU, Requiring Oxygen Supplementation or Hospitalised1, by Age GroupsUpdate on vaccination progress 5.  As of 17 September 2021, 82% of our population has completed their full regimen/ received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 84% has received at least one dose. 6.  We have administered a total of 8,922,035 doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme (Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty and Moderna), covering 4,571,939 individuals, with 4,444,525 individuals having completed the full vaccination regimen. In addition, 182,716 doses of other vaccines recognised in the World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) have been administered, covering 86,968 individuals. Locally transmitted COVID-19 cases 7.  As of 18 September 2021, 12pm, the Ministry of Health has detected a total of 1,009 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, comprising 926 community cases, 78 dormitory residents cases and 5 imported cases. a)    Active clusters under close monitoring 8.  We are closely monitoring the clusters listed below, which have already been ringfenced through tracing, testing and isolation.Figure 4: Large Clusters with New CasesClusterNew CasesTotal4RemarksPfizer Asia Pacific Pte Ltd722Workplace transmission, no evidence of spread beyond worksite.

SGP,Asia,Singapore,19/9/2021,77804,1012,873.857,60,0,0.286,14266.54,185.565,160.235,Setting Up of Stepped-up Community Care Facilities,"        With the increase in COVID-19 cases, the Ministry of Health (MOH) is setting up new community care facilities that provide clinical care to COVID-19 patients who are stable, have mild symptoms and/or are generally clinically-well but have underlying conditions that require a closer monitoring of their disease course. This will augment our hospital capacity, so that only those who actually need close and specialised medical attention, such as oxygen supplementation and intensive care, receive their medical care in our hospitals. 2.     MOH will set up a new category of Community Care Facility (CCF), namely the Stepped-Up Community Care Facility with more comprehensive medical coverage, to care and manage elderly patients who are stable, mildly symptomatic, clinically-well but with some underlying chronic illnesses or comorbidities (e.g. cardiac, neurological or respiratory diseases, or weakened immune response) that could make them more susceptible to a potential worsening of illness. While this specific group of elderly patients are not at a high risk of deterioration to the extent of requiring oxygen supplementation or care in the intensive care unit (ICU), they will require closer monitoring of their pre-existing medical conditions as well as for any early signs of clinical deterioration. For the low percentage of those who do see a deterioration, they will immediately be sent back to our hospitals for further management. 3.     In addition to the care provided at CCFs today, the  Stepped-Up Community Care Facility will be adequately resourced with more medical and nursing manpower, as well as medical monitoring devices to ensure the optimal level of care for these patients. Suitable COVID-19 patients from nursing homes will also be prioritised for admission, to mitigate potential further spread within residential long-term care facilities should cases be detected among their residents. 4.     We are working with Woodlands Health on standing up the first Stepped-Up Community Care Facility by repurposing the NTUC Health Nursing Home (Tampines) at 1 Tampines Ave Street 22. The Stepped-Up CCF, which will have 250 beds, will be operational on 23 September 2021. MOH has worked closely with NTUC Health and Agency for Integrated Care to transfer existing nursing home residents into other NTUC Health Nursing Home branches. Alternative care arrangements has also been secured for those awaiting admission to this nursing home. We thank the families and next-of-kin of the nursing home residents and NTUC Health for their understanding and cooperation in facilitating this shift to meet a national need. 5.     In addition, MOH is working with our existing service providers to enhance some existing CCFs to operate part of their capacity as Stepped-Up Community Care Facilities, so that they can also manage and closely monitor the same profile of elderly patients who are stable, mildly symptomatic and/or generally clinical-well, but with chronic illnesses or comorbidities. This includes Raffles Medical Group augmenting its CCF at Connect@Changi, starting from 20 September 2021, to provide a total of 50 such beds when fully operational on 24 September 2021.  6.     To expedite care for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring conveyance to CCFs, we have also extended the timing of the conveyances and admissions to CCFs to be around-the-clock. We request for the understanding and cooperation of COVID-19 patients to adhere to their allocated conveyancing timing even if these are later in the night, to ensure their speedy conveyance to the CCFs. 7.     We are continuously monitoring our hospital capacity and urge those with mild symptoms not to go to the hospital Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments. Such individuals should instead consult a General Practitioner (GP) at a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic. The SASH GPs are capable of more responsively assessing the severity of their symptoms, performing the necessary COVID-19 diagnostic tests and providing adequate medical care to manage mild symptoms. 8.     Similarly, individuals confirmed with COVID-19 but who are asymptomatic should continue to stay home and seek telemedicine consultation first if they start to feel unwell. They should avoid going to the A&E departments of hospitals unless they have severe symptoms (such as chest pain or shortness of breath) that the telemedicine doctor assesses to necessitate conveying them to hospital for treatment. This is to prevent fruitless trips to the A&E departments which may inadvertently increase the risk of them transmitting COVID-19 to the others in the community.MINISTRY OF HEALTH19 SEPTEMBER 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/setting-up-of-stepped-up-community-care-facilities,

The detection of these cases had led to ward closures and staff quarantine which had impacted some hospitals, putting a strain on hospital bed capacity and staffing at a time when more hospital beds are ramped up to care for hospitalised COVID-19 patients. To safeguard hospital capacity, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will introduce tightened measures at all public, community and private hospitals from 24 September 2021. We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients, their family members and loved ones as we work to safeguard them and hospital staff and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our healthcare institutions.Visitor Management Measures2. All visitations to hospital wards1 will be suspended for a period of four weeks, from 24 September to 23 October 2021 (both dates inclusive). However, the following patient groups will be allowed visitation on a case-by case basis, as assessed by the hospital: a. Patients who are in critical condition; b. Paediatric patients;c. Birthing/post-partum mothers; and d. Patients requiring additional care support from caregivers. Examples include assistance of inpatients who have mental incapacities or family members who are undergoing caregiver training to better care for their loved ones after hospital discharge. 3. The above patient groups would be allowed only one pre-designated visitor, with one visit per day. Patients who are in critical condition may be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors, with a maximum of two visitors at the patient’s bedside at any one time. 4. All visitors approved to visit will need to produce a valid negative antigen rapid test (ART) or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result obtained within the last 24 hours of each visit, as administered or supervised by MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers (including tests performed at Quick Test Centres). This is a mandatory requirement for all visitors, regardless of the individual’s vaccination status, except for persons who have recovered from COVID-19 and are able to present a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) exemption notice2.5. All visitors approved to visit must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabrics. There must be no eating or drinking in the inpatient wards. Visitors must not use the patients’ toilets in the wards and must avoid sitting on patients’ beds.ART Surveillance Testing For ED Patients 6. The Emergency departments (ED) of our hospitals are usually crowded.  Currently patients presenting with acute respiratory infection (ARI) symptoms at the hospitals’ ED or 24-hour emergency clinic will be segregated from the other patients. However, with more COVID-19 cases presenting pre-symptomatically or asymptomatically, testing will be needed to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission at the ED.7. From 24 September, the following groups of higher-risk patients, regardless of vaccination status3, will be required to undergo mandatory ART testing at the EDs / 24-hour emergency clinic:a. Patients who are lodged in ED beds for prolonged observation in the short stay unit or Extended Diagnostic and Treatment Unit (or in the observation bay/wards in the private hospitals); andb. Patients who are required to undergo mask-off assessment and/or procedures lasting for 15 minutes or more Accompanying persons allowed to stay with the patients throughout the observation period (beyond 30 minutes) will also be subjected to the ART test. The government will subsidise the costs of ART for both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients until the end of 2021. Accompanying persons may have to pay for the tests, depending on the hospitals.8. We urge those who have non-emergency conditions or mild symptoms to avoid seeking treatment at the hospitals and consult a General Practitioner (GP) or Urgent Care Centres instead. For those who are concerned that you may be infected with COVID-19, you may proceed to a Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinic instead. The SASH GPs will assess the severity of your symptoms and perform COVID-19 diagnostic tests when needed to confirm your health status. This will allow patients with more severe illnesses and who require emergency urgent care to be attended to quickly and helps to preserve hospital capacity for those who truly need hospital care.9. To identify staff with COVID-19 infections early, MOH has also increased surveillance testing frequency for hospital staff, as well as vendors who work in the hospital.10. MOH will review and calibrate these measures regularly in line with the evolving situation, and we seek the understanding and cooperation of all Singaporeans, as the measures will safeguard our hospital staff and patients and reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission in our healthcare institutions.[1] Includes public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals[2] Recovered individuals (within last 270 days) can obtain a PET Exemption Notice from any clinic offering ART or PCR testing services.[3] Patients who had recovered from a previous COVID-19 infection less than 270 days ago would be exempted from the surveillance testing but should be tested by PCR if symptomatic.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/tightened-measures-to-reduce-hospital-covid-19-transmission-and-preserve-hospital-capacity,

A very good morning. I am delighted to be back, once again, at the annual Community Care Manpower Development Awards (CCMDA) ceremony. It did not feel too long ago when we just at this ceremony last year, but certainly, time has passed quite quickly, even in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Every year, we come back together, to try to honour the achievements of many of our contributors and our staff in the community care sector.2.   Since CCMDA was launched in 2017, we’ve presented more than 550 CCMDA awards. This year, we are happy to present more than 160 awards, our largest number ever.3. To our award recipients, congratulations, but more importantly, thank you, for your commitment to upskill yourselves despite such challenging times. To our community care organisations, thank you for investing in the careers of your employees.Upsurge in Appreciation and Interest in Community Care Sector4.  COVID-19 has disrupted our lives, our work, and our studies. But it has also shone a spotlight on the sacrifices and contributions of our healthcare workers, especially those in the community care sector. Amidst the uncertainty of 2020, we read heartwarming stories of healthcare workers who placed duty above themselves. You saw in the video at the beginning of this ceremony, that the ability to care is present in every one of us. For us in the community care sector, compassion is the engine that drives many of the things we do in healthcare, and our healthcare workers have demonstrated this ability and this compassion very perfectly. In the past one and a half years, there has been a groundswell of appreciation for healthcare workers, and a surge of interest in the work they do. Within the community care sector, more CCMDA awards have been given to fresh entrants to the sector. This shows that there is growing recognition and interest in this sector, particularly among younger Singaporeans.5. One of them is Ms Tan Hui Yi, who has taken up a CCMDA award to pursue a Social Work degree at NUS after completing her ‘A’ levels. She became interested in the community care sector when a family member shared that her end-of-life wish was to pass on at home. As she learnt more about the critical role played by the sector in caring for elderly Singaporeans, it spurred her passion to help seniors find comfort in ageing with dignity and passing on in a familiar environment. As a fresh graduate, Hui Yi will join Lee Ah Mooi Nursing Home as a Medical Social Worker. I salute her desire to help seniors age with grace. Thank you for stepping up to be the next generation that will carry the baton forward.6.  To make CCMDA more accessible to fresh entrants like Hui Yi, we launched a new CCMDA website and online application portal on Brightsparks in January. This one-stop portal allows students to learn more about the community care sector and submit their applications. We hope that many more will come to know the community care sector, and know that better and to also to choose to pursue a fulfilling career in this sector with its wide array of job opportunities.Building a Future-Ready Community Care Workforce7.  Even as Singapore learns to live with COVID-19, we will continue to face new, unknown challenges. We must therefore remain vigilant, constantly innovate and refine our processes, so that we can provide better care to the patients that we serve. All of you are here today because you have taken up further studies to enhance your skill sets to meet changing care needs of our patients. The constant desire to learn and upskill will be critical for us to be a future-ready workforce.8. We also need strong leadership to tackle the challenges ahead. As nurses play a key role in the community care sector, we need strong nursing leadership and strong nursing leaders to guide us forward and push new boundaries in care delivery. Last year, we launched the Community Care Nursing Leadership Programme (CCNLP) to attract and develop nursing leaders in community care organisations. Our first batch of 16 nurses will benefit from this clinical training, leadership development, attachments, and executive coaching to nurture them as future nursing leaders.9. One of them is Ms Quek Yanting, a Nurse Manager from Dover Park Hospice. Yanting is also a proud recipient of the CCMDA today, where she has been sponsored to pursue a specialist diploma in palliative care nursing. She will be sharing more about her career aspirations via a live chat session later. I certainly hope her story will resonate with you, and motivate you to pursue continual growth and learning. For those of you who are leaders and managers, I hope her sharing inspire you to seek out opportunities to support your team’s growth.Successful Job Redesign (JR) Pilot to Progress onto Next Phase with Early Adopters10.  Future-proofing the community care workforce goes beyond the individual. Organisations too, must stay nimble and be willing to embrace change. Last year, I announced that we would embark on a job redesign effort for staff in community care and in support care. The aim was to blend different support care roles, functions, and encourage cross-deployment, multi-skilling and enhance career progression.11.  I am happy to update that four community care organisations have come onboard to test out the redesigned role through a work trial. The redesigned role focuses on enhancing support care staff’s skills in basic nursing, therapy tasks, and psychosocial care. This creates a blended role which can open up opportunities for staff to further their skills and wage progression. With the learning from this pilot phase, we look forward to supporting early adopters in the next phase of our job redesign journey and encourage more community care organisations to come onboard in this particular effort.Closing12.  In closing, let me say that, our community care workers play a critical role in looking after not just the physical health of our seniors, but importantly, their social and psychological well-being too. I want to encourage all community care employers to work with AIC and invest in your workforce by strengthening their capabilities, developing leaders, and creating opportunities for career progression. This will make the sector much more attractive to jobseekers. Through the years, the CCMDA has provided substantial opportunities and support to attract new entrants, as well as retain and upskill our community care workforce. For all the CCMDA award recipients today, we applaud your attitude towards lifelong learning, and we fully support your aspirations to innovate and enhance care delivery. AIC and MOH will support you with more career development and progression pathways, and help you keep pace with changing community care needs.13.  Once again, congratulations to all our CCMDA award recipients. I wish you the very best, as you embark on this meaningful journey to improve the lives of our seniors, helping them live and age well, at home and in the community.Thank you very much.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-dr-koh-poh-koon-senior-minister-of-state-ministry-of-health-ministry-of-manpower-at-the-community-care-manpower-development-awards-ceremony-2021,
SGP,Asia,Singapore,24/9/2021,84510,1650,1246.714,73,3,2,15496.186,302.552,228.604,Stabilising Our Covid-19 Situation and  Protecting Our Overall Healthcare Capacity,"      Singapore entered the Preparatory Stage of our transition journey to a COVID-19 resilient nation on 19 August 2021. We ramped up our healthcare and response capacity as daily cases increased. We also introduced Home Recovery, as most of the cases, especially younger or vaccinated individuals, have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic and can stay at home to recover.2.    However, daily cases started to rise exponentially from end of August 2021. While the number of COVID-positive individuals who become severely ill – i.e., requiring oxygen supplementation and intensive care unit (ICU) – remains within expectations, the number of individuals with mild symptoms has increased very rapidly. This has put a strain on our overall healthcare and response system and on our healthcare workers, as many COVID-positive individuals with mild symptoms are seeking medical attention at our hospitals when it might not be necessary. 3.    While we have been advising individuals with mild COVID-19 symptoms that it is appropriate to recover at home, we understand the anxiety of some individuals to want to seek medical attention at hospitals. The protocols and processes for home recovery are also new, and we are still improving the system as people are adjusting to them. There have also been service lapses as the numbers on Home Recovery increased, which added to their anxiety. We are ironing out the teething issues with the Home Recovery programme, and in the coming few weeks, will further ramp up our care facilities to handle more cases. 4.    Most infection cases are mild in symptoms or asymptomatic and home recovery is the most appropriate care protocol for them. But if the overall number of cases continues to rise rapidly, we are also likely to see a growing number of infected persons, especially among the elderly, who do need hospital care. Hence, there is a need to slow down community transmission. We will thus be tightening our community safe management measures until our overall healthcare and response capacity has been appropriately augmented. Updates on Local COVID-19 Situation5.    The large majority (98%) of cases were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. This is due to our high vaccination coverage, which is now at 82% of the population who have completed their full regimen. Of the 254 cases with severe illness in the last two weeks, a disproportionate 48% were unvaccinated with the remainder being vaccinated individuals with co-morbidities. This ratio needs to be understood in the context of more than 80% of our population being fully vaccinated, indicating a vaccine efficacy against severe illnesses that is still around 80% to 90%, with the elderly and individuals with co-morbidities among the vaccinated making up the 10% to 20% who remain susceptible despite vaccination. 6.    The number of persons requiring ICU is rising at the same rate as our overall case numbers, albeit with a lag. We had 21 new cases in ICU in the past week, as compared to 9 in the preceding week.     Right-siting Patients for Appropriate Care7.    The most appropriate care management protocol for fully vaccinated individuals aged 12 to 69 years will continue to be recovery at home[1]. These individuals are less likely to fall severely ill and there is no need for them to be cared for in our hospitals. Similarly, parents with infected children aged 2 to 11 years who choose to home recovery may also do so after their children have been assessed in our hospitals for suitability to do so. 8.    To make best use of our hospital facilities and beds, and allow our hospitals to care for both their COVID-19 patients as well as the many other non-COVID patients requiring hospital care, we will be admitting those who are stable but do require closer monitoring to appropriate intermediate care facilities where their care and close monitoring needs will be met.    9.    Patients with co-morbidities, with a risk of potentially developing severe illness, but who are otherwise asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic will be closely monitored at Community Treatment Facilities (CTFs), which are being set up progressively islandwide. These CTFs will be closely partnered with our hospitals so that there will be seamless escalation protocols for such patients to be conveyed from the CTF to an acute hospital expeditiously for further treatment when necessary. This is similar to the existing protocol  for Community Care Facilities (CCFs), but with a higher level of medical care at the CTFs to ensure that these patients who are stable but at higher risk of serious illness are cared for with the appropriate level of medical manning and supporting equipment.  Safe Management Measures for Stabilisation Phase10.    If the infection continues at its current trajectory, we can expect to reach a daily count of 3,200 and beyond within the next 2 weeks. Beyond that, there is a range of possibilities, but we cannot rule out cases doubling further. To minimise the strain on our overall healthcare capacity, we will have to tighten measures before that happens. We would like to thank Singaporeans for reducing their level of activity and interactions in the past two weeks. We do not need to return to a Heightened Alert. But we have to do more to scale back social interactions further in order to slow down community transmissions and allow for better stability. The following measures will take effect from 27 September 2021 through 24 October 2021. We will review the measures two weeks after implementation and adjust these based on the community situation then. Please refer to Annex A for details.  Permissible Group Sizes11.    Permissible group sizes for social gatherings will be reduced from a maximum of 5 persons to a maximum of 2 persons. Correspondingly, the maximum number of unique visitors per household will be reduced to 2 per day. Individuals should continue to limit their overall number of social gatherings to not more than 1 per day, whether to another household, or meeting with friends and family members in a public place.  Protecting Our Vulnerable Groups12.    We strongly encourage all individuals to reduce social activities and wear our masks diligently. In particular, the elderly and persons with comorbidities who are more vulnerable to severe illnesses, should stay home as much as possible, except for essential activities such as working, buying food and groceries, seeing the doctor, and exercising individually in uncrowded locations.    13.    In order to better protect younger children who are not yet medically eligible for vaccination, the Ministry of Education (MOE) had earlier announced that Home-Based Learning (HBL) will be implemented for all Primary and Special Education (SPED) schools from 27 September through 6 October 2021. Primary 6 students will go on a study break prior to the Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) from 25 September through 29 September 2021. As an added precaution, the HBL period will now be extended till 7 October 2021, so that students can continue to stay home for the rest of the week.  14.    Private Education Institutions (PEIs) must also implement HBL for all students aged 12 years and below from 27 September to 10 October 2021, although preschool services in PEIs may remain open. During this period, in-person tuition and enrichment classes for students aged 12 years and below must pivot online or otherwise be suspended. Preschools, MOE kindergartens, KCare Services and Student Care Centres will remain open during this period but parents are encouraged to keep their children at home if they can. Please refer to MOE’s website for more details.  Minimising Workplace Interactions 15.    Work-from-home will be the default for employees who are able to work from home. During this period, the 10-day snap Work from Home regime will be suspended. There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites for those who need to go into worksites to work. Social gatherings at the workplace will continue to be disallowed. Employers should continue to implement flexible working hours and stagger the start times of employees who need to return to the workplace.  16.    Employees, contractors, and vendors who are unable to work from home are strongly encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) to keep infected employees from coming to work and keep their workplace safe. Those who are able to work from home but need to return to the workplace for ad-hoc reasons are strongly encouraged to perform an ART. They should be tested negative before returning onsite.   Dine-in at F&B Establishments17.    Groups of up to 2 persons will be allowed to dine-in at regular F&B establishments if all the diners are fully vaccinated. This is a reduction from the current limit of 5 persons for dine-in. Unvaccinated individuals with a valid negative pre-event test (PET) result, recovered individuals, and children aged 12 years and below may also be included in such groups of 2.  18.    F&B establishments that are not able to ensure that all dine-in patrons meet the criteria for full vaccination may only operate take-away and delivery services. At this stage of the transition, entertainment such as live performances, recorded music, and videos/TV screening will continue to be prohibited. Patrons to F&B establishments are also reminded to adhere to all safe management measures and keep their masks on at all times except when eating or drinking.  19.    Because hawker centres and coffee shops offer essential food services to the community, the concession to dine-in at these premises will remain at up to 2 persons, regardless of vaccination status.  Activity and Event Sizes and Pre-Event Testing Requirements20.    Vaccination-differentiated safe management measures, mask wearing, and proper distancing remain essential to ensure that large events can proceed safely for attendees. The event sizes and capacity limits for congregational and other worship services, cinemas, MICE, live performances, spectator sport events will remain at up to 1,000 attendees if all are fully vaccinated. Otherwise, only up to 50 attendees will be allowed without PET. The concession for children aged 12 years and below, who cannot yet be vaccinated, will also apply for these events. Such unvaccinated children may be included in a group of up to two persons if the child is from the same household.   21.    Marriage solemnisations may continue, seated in groups of up to 2 persons, if all are fully vaccinated. Home solemnisations will continue to be allowed with up to 10 attendees. Otherwise, only up to 50 attendees will be allowed without PET. We acknowledge that wedding couples have faced significant uncertainties over the past few months. Hence, as a special concession, wedding receptions may be allowed to continue with up to 250 attendees if all are fully vaccinated, and with a group size of up to 5 persons per table. All wedding guests must strictly abide by the safe management measures, and in particular maintain social distancing and avoid mingling with others beyond their own table. Given their higher vulnerability, we also strongly discourage unvaccinated individuals and the elderly from attending such events, as PET only reduces their risk to others but not the risk to themselves.  Targeted Support Measures22.    The Government will enhance the Jobs Support Scheme support to 25% for the period of 27 September 2021 through 24 October 2021 for sectors significantly affected by the tightened measures. These include F&B, retail, cinemas, museums, art galleries, historical sites, family entertainment, tourism, gyms and fitness studios, and performing arts and arts education. Please refer to Annex B for details.  23.    The Government will provide a 2-week rental waiver for qualifying tenants on Government-owned commercial properties. Qualifying tenant-occupiers and owner-occupiers of privately-owned commercial properties will also be given a 2-week rental relief cash payout under the Rental Support Scheme (RSS)[2]. These will offset rent for half the duration of the stabilisation phase. More details on the RSS will be made available on the Inland Revenue Authority Singapore (IRAS) website.  24.    Cooked food and market stallholders in centres managed by the National Environment Agency (NEA) or NEA-appointed operators will receive a 2-week rental waiver.  25.    To support taxi and private hire car drivers, we will also extend the COVID-19 Driver Relief Fund payout at $10 and $5 per vehicle per day in October and November 2021 respectively.    26.    The total sum of the support measures is $650m. This will be funded from the higher-than-expected revenues collected to-date. There will be no further draw on Past Reserves.  Encouraging Regular Self-Testing for All27.    Regular testing is key to early detection of possible COVID-19 infection and allows individuals who test positive to take precautions to self-isolate and protect their family, friends, and colleagues. Individuals are encouraged to use their free kits distributed through the nationwide distribution to self-test before visiting crowded places such as wet markets and hawker centres or visiting elderly or children. Those who are unable to work from home or who have to attend school are also encouraged to self-test.  28.    Firms with employees that work onsite and are not already subject to mandatory RRT may apply for 8 ART kits per onsite employee for weekly testing of their staff over a two-month period as previously announced[3]. Applications are open until 13 October and we strongly encourage firms with employees who are unable to work from home, to apply for ART kits. More details may be found at www.go.gov.sg/time-limited-rrt-art.   29.    From 1 October 2021, we will also publish on the MOH website a map of areas frequented recently by a larger number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. We hope this can help guide individuals on your movement and activities. Individuals who have been to these hotspots during the same timeframe are encouraged to monitor their health, perform regular ART self-tests throughout the 10 days following their potential exposure, and minimise any unnecessary interaction with others. SafeEntry and TraceTogether would continue to be used to inform individuals of recent confirmed close contacts to infected persons or recent exposure to an area of increased spread through Health Risk Alerts and Health Risk Warnings.  30.    There have also been many queries over various tests – for Quarantine, Health Risk Warnings, Health Risk Alerts. We will be putting out public information through public advisory advertisements in the newspapers to help guide the public.   Increased Weekend Testing Options for Individuals with Acute Respiratory Symptoms31.     Currently, individuals with acute respiratory symptoms can visit private GP clinics – called Swab and Send Home (SASH) clinics – to take a confirmatory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) swab test. However, we recognise that not all SASH clinics are open on weekends to serve such individuals. To facilitate prompt testing over weekends, from 25 September 2021 (Saturday),we will open 8 Regional Screening Centres (RSCs) and 3 Quick Test Centres (QTCs) on Saturdays and Sundays, so that such individuals may get a free confirmatory PCR test. Such weekend visits to the RSCs and QTCs are by appointment only, to prevent overcrowding, with appointment booking only open from Friday, 6pm to Sunday, 3pm of each weekend for bookings on that weekend. More details are at www.go.gov.sg/ari-weekend-testing. We encourage symptomatic individuals to get their confirmatory PCR test quickly so that they can get appropriate care, if needed. This will also provide earlier protection to family members, colleagues and friends who might otherwise come into contact with the infected individual.  Expanding the Booster Vaccination Strategy32.    On 15 September 2021, we commenced the booster programme for persons aged 60 and above and residents of aged care facilities. As of 23 September 2021, almost 91,500 seniors have received their booster dose. 56% of seniors who have been invited to-date for their booster dose have either booked an appointment or already received their booster dose.  33.    The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) has been closely monitoring the data regarding the need for additional vaccine doses. It has further recommended for persons aged 50 to 59 years to receive a booster dose of the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) mRNA vaccine from six months after completing their primary course of vaccination. Adults aged 50 to 59 years have a higher risk of underlying comorbidities and hence a risk of severe illness as compared to younger persons, and as many would have completed the full regimen of their primary course of vaccination earlier in the year, their levels of protection could have decreased over time. Boosting the immunity of members of our population will ensure continued high levels of protection against severe disease.  34.    MOH agrees with the EC19V’s recommendations. From 4 October 2021, we will progressively invite persons aged 50 to 59 years who have completed their vaccination regimen with two doses at least six months ago to receive their booster dose of a PSAR mRNA vaccine. An SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the mobile number that they had registered with for their first two doses, for them to book a new appointment on www.vaccine.gov.sg. These individuals may receive their booster dose at any vaccination centre, polyclinic, or participating Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC).  Moderna Vaccine Dosage 35.    The EC19V has also further reviewed the dosing for the Moderna vaccine used for boosting and recommended that 50mcg of the Moderna vaccine be used for boosting given evidence that a 50mcg dosage is sufficient to boost immune response significantly. Based on EC19V recommendations and to ensure the efficient use of vaccines, from 25 September 2021, vaccination sites carrying the Moderna vaccine will begin administering the vaccine at a dosage of 50mcg for booster doses, as compared to the 100mcg dose used in the primary vaccination course. There are no safety concerns in persons who have already received 100mcg of the Moderna vaccine for their booster dose.   36.    The 100mcg dose of the Moderna vaccine will continue to be used for the two-dose primary series vaccination regimen, and three-dose enhanced primary series for immunocompromised persons. For the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine, there is no change in dosage for both the primary series and the booster dose.  Towards a COVID-19 Resilient Singapore37.    We are staying the course to transit towards a COVID-19 resilient nation. But we are still at the Preparatory Stage and have not reached the stage where COVID-19 can be considered as endemic. In this journey towards living with COVID-19, we have to make continual adjustments in our measures to protect our healthcare system, and ensure it is not overwhelmed.    38.    During this stabilisation phase, we seek everyone’s cooperation to observe all safe management measures so that we can lower transmission risks and slow down the pace of community infections. Everyone needs to be socially responsible to take care of themselves and minimise their unnecessary movement and social interactions. If you have been exposed to positive cases, please isolate yourself, test yourself regularly and seek medical treatment if you are symptomatic.MINISTRY OF HEALTH 24 SEPTEMBER 2021 [1] The eligibility criteria are: (a) Fully vaccinated with PSAR mRNA vaccine, (b) age 2-69 years old, (c) no other severe illnesses or diseases and (d) no household members above 80 years old or belonging to the vulnerable group.[2] Small and Medium Enterprises and eligible Non-Profit Organisations with an annual revenue not exceeding $100 million, who are tenant-occupiers or owner-occupiers of qualifying commercial properties, will be eligible for rental relief.[3] Refer to the MOH press release titled ‘Collective Actions to Slow Down Community Transmission’ on 6 September 2021: https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/collective-actions-to-slow-down-community-transmission",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/stabilising-our-covid-19-situation-and-protecting-our-overall-healthcare-capacity_24September2021,

I am delighted to join you today at the Singapore Pharmacy Week 2021 organised by the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore (PSS).2.    This is the second time that the annual Pharmacy Week carnival has gone virtual. I am heartened to learn that the inaugural virtual Pharmacy Week carnival held last year won the International Pharmaceutical Federation 2021 Health Promotion Campaign Award. My heartfelt congratulations to the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore for their innovative approach to educate and empower the public to improve their health.    3.   As trusted healthcare professionals, pharmacists provide expert advice on disease prevention, and the safe and effective use of medications. This year’s Pharmacy Week theme of ‘Partnering You In Your Health Journey’ highlights the importance of partnership between pharmacists and patients of all ages and in various care settings, to achieve the desired health outcomes. 4.    Community pharmacists, being most accessible to the public, serve multiple roles in partnering the public in their health journey. The public can walk into a pharmacy to receive advice on health-related queries such as nutritional needs, vaccination, and preventive health. This includes the Start To S.T.O.P. Programme championed by our community pharmacists, which helps patients to quit smoking through personalised counselling sessions by a dedicated pharmacist. The public can also walk into the community pharmacy and seek treatment for minor ailments such as skin rashes, fungal infections of the skin, gastroesophageal reflux, constipation, dry eyes, conjunctivitis and others. Additionally, our community pharmacies are now touchpoints for the public to reorder and pick-up subsidised medication from public health systems and hundreds of patients have benefitted from this new service. 5.   Beyond the physical pharmacy, both community and hospital pharmacists have moved into the care centres as well as patients’ home to partner older patients, their caregivers and the healthcare team for better chronic disease management. Pharmacists play an important role in advocating appropriate drug use and proper storage in the home environment, reducing wastage and improving patients’ overall medication adherence. 6.    Patients in nursing homes and community hospitals across the island have also benefitted from pharmacists’ efforts in cutting out unnecessary medications and simplifying dosing regimens. Besides reviewing the residents’ medications, pharmacists also promote good medication management practices together with other healthcare professionals within intermediate and long-term care institutions.  7.    The COVID-19 pandemic has not dampened the pharmacists care for patients. In fact, pharmacists have embraced telehealth platforms to provide clinical services such as anticoagulation therapy monitoring, for patients who have suffered a stroke or myocardial infarction. In doing so, pharmacists continue to partner their patients in keeping their health and medical conditions in check during this challenging time.8.    Pharmacists have also been actively involved in patient counselling and educational campaigns to improve patients’ health literacy. Through the efforts of the PSS National Medication Information Workgroup, the public can now access these easy-to-understand and reliable drug information in a localised context for free, anytime, anywhere via HealthHub. Health-related information such COVID-19 myth busters and hand hygiene posters can also be found on the PSS website.9.    Behind the scenes, pharmacists in the Health Sciences Authority (the HSA) and pharmaceutical companies ensure that medications registered in Singapore are of good quality, safety and efficacy. There are also informatics pharmacists, who manage medication-related data, ensuring that the data flows to healthcare providers and patients quickly and accurately. There are also those who have taken on roles such as educators, researchers and entrepreneurs, to contribute to better patient care. 10.   These are just some of the many roles pharmacists play and their important contributions to our healthcare system. This event is an opportunity for our pharmacists to share their expertise and provide useful information for managing various conditions.11.    I am also pleased to learn that this is the first year PSS has partnered with the People’s Association during Pharmacy Week, to conduct a large-scale virtual brown-bagging campaign with free pharmacist consultations for PAssion Card members. I am sure that this will be very much welcome for Passion card members. For those who prefer face-to-face consultations, those are available until 31 October at participating retail pharmacies across Singapore. I believe that the public would gain better understanding about their medications and health from these efforts. 12.    In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity to thank the organising committee for this meaningful event. I would also like to wish all our pharmacists a Happy World Pharmacists’ Day. Thank you for partnering Singaporeans in their health journey.13.    I wish everyone an informative and fruitful morning. Thank you very much. ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/opening-remarks-by-dr-koh-poh-koon-senior-minister-of-state-ministry-of-health-and-ministry-of-manpower-at-the-opening-ceremony-of-singapore-pharmacy-week-2021-on-25-september-2021,

We are operating against a backdrop of an ageing population and concomitant increase in chronic disease prevalence. We therefore need to shift our focus to upstream preventive and early disease management to reduce downstream health complications. By the time a patient has to visit the hospital, it is usually too late. Therefore, primary care, delivered in the community, must increasingly anchor our healthcare system.3.     Bukit Panjang Polyclinic is our 21st in Singapore. It is part of the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) plan to expand our polyclinic network to 32 by 2030. Although I am here at Bukit Panjang with the team from the National University Health System, I am also happy to share that Kallang Polyclinic, under the National Healthcare Group, is also opening its doors to the residents and patients today. Eunos Polyclinic, under SingHealth, will be opening in December this year.4.     At the same time, we are consolidating Bukit Merah and Outram Polyclinics into a larger new polyclinic in Tiong Bahru by 2030. Bukit Merah and Outram Polyclinics are smaller polyclinics and have been serving residents since 1981 and 1997 respectively. With the rising and evolving healthcare needs of the residents in the area, we need a polyclinic with a wider range of capabilities and services to serve the needs of residents living in that area. Residents can look forward to a new polyclinic that will be more spacious, and provide better services, with elderly-friendly and accessibility features.5.     Let me say something about these new polyclinics. They will provide services from medical treatment for acute conditions and chronic disease management, to women and child health services, allied health services, and radiological, laboratory and pharmacy services. In addition, there are two new features worth highlighting.6.     First, they are part of an integrated development. Bukit Panjang Polyclinic is the first polyclinic co-located with a nursing home, in this 12-storey integrated healthcare facility. The integrated development also includes a senior care centre, which provides 60 day-care places. Similarly, Kallang Polyclinic is co-located with a chronic sick unit, while Eunos Polyclinic is co-located with a senior care centre.7.     By co-locating polyclinics with healthcare facilities or community facilities, which include amenities such as sports centres, we open up opportunities to develop joint programmes that cater to holistic care, and improve the health of the population.8.     Besides Bukit Panjang, Kallang and Eunos, in the next nine years, we aim to open another nine polyclinics in integrated developments that are either co-located with other healthcare facilities or with community facilities. Sembawang Polyclinic, for example, is part of an upcoming community hub called Bukit Canberra, and is co-located with sports facilities, such as swimming pools, a gym, an indoor sport hall, as well as a park and a hawker centre.9.     Second, polyclinics will progressively implement new models of care. For instance, polyclinics have introduced team-based care models where chronic patients would be managed by regular, multi-disciplinary care teams. By allowing the same care team to attend to the patient, there is continuity, and more importantly, it builds relationship and trust between patients and their care team.10.     Polyclinics have also accelerated the roll out of telehealth services to improve patients’ access to care, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. These services range from tele-consultations to remote vital signs monitoring, such as the Primary Tech-Enhanced Care pilot for hypertension.11.     It has been a challenge for our polyclinic clusters to deliver these new polyclinics amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. You have to navigate through many uncertainties and risks of delay. But you delivered, even as you work tirelessly to support our nation’s efforts in combatting COVID-19. I thank you for your dedication, and your efforts to see through these projects and improve residents’ access to quality and affordable primary care services.12.     I also want to thank the support of the local Advisors, community partners and residents, for giving us ground advice, and helping residents familiarise with the new polyclinic.

In light of the emergence of several new clusters at Homes in the past two weeks and the continued rise of COVID-19 cases within the community, we will be extending the suspension of in-person visits to all Homes to 24 October 2021 (inclusive). This is in line with the Stabilisation Phase and will reduce the risk of transmission of COVID-19 from the community to the Homes. The extension will also provide more time for our seniors in the Homes to get vaccinated or receive their booster shots. 2.         We urge the next-of-kin of unvaccinated seniors in the Homes to support and encourage their loved ones to get vaccinated. Unvaccinated seniors are more likely to suffer severe illness if infected. It is also important for vaccinated seniors to receive their booster dose immediately when they become eligible, to ensure a continued high level of immunity and protection from severe disease. 3.         To ensure that seniors remain connected with their loved ones, the Homes will continue to offer caregivers/next-of-kin the option of telephone or video calls as an alternative to physical visits. 4.         We will observe the situation in the coming weeks and will review the suspension of visitation accordingly.

It is my pleasure to join you today at the Singapore Health and Biomedical Congress 2021. 2.     Before I begin my address, I would first like to express my deepest gratitude and appreciation to all our healthcare workers present. The past two years have been extremely challenging for our healthcare family – all of you have been at the forefront of our nation’s fight against COVID-19. I have personally seen and witnessed the selfless dedication of many of our healthcare workers, often going beyond the call of duty, making countless sacrifices, in order to keep our people safe. Thank you!3.     Despite the current evolving situation, I am confident that our resilience and collective social responsibility as a nation, will serve us well, as we move towards COVID-resilience. This is also linked to this year’s theme on ‘The Brave New World of Healthcare’, charting out our journey towards a COVID-19 resilient nation, as we brave new frontiers together as one healthcare family.Changing Operating Environment4.     The pandemic has taught us two lessons – first, that the resilience of a country’s healthcare system is key to its success in containing the virus; and second, pandemics are fought not only at the frontlines of our healthcare systems, but also on the social front. Whether countries succeeded, depended on how robust their social systems were, and how much people trusted their governments.5.     Fortunately, in Singapore, we have built our health and social systems on strong foundations and fundamentals. We have a renowned healthcare system, delivering one of the highest standards of healthcare and outcomes globally. Our healthcare system is also a core part of our Social Compact, where we ensure that all Singaporeans can access affordable and quality healthcare services. Providing them with a peace of mind and certainty against life’s vicissitudes. And where we unite our society, across public, people and private sectors, to uplift those with less among us. We have seen this during the crisis – as individuals, family members, neighbours, businesses banded together with our healthcare workers, government agencies – to care for those affected.6.     However, our operating environment will become more challenging going forward. COVID-19 will not be the last health crisis and we will also face new social challenges. Our society is ageing, and this will bring about new challenges. While our people may have one of the longest life expectancies, about 10 years of our lives are spent in poor health. An ageing population, coupled with unhealthy lifestyle behaviours associated with modern living, such as unhealthy diet and physical inactivity, will lead to an increase in the prevalence of frailty and chronic diseases. This will in turn drive up healthcare costs. If left unchecked, it will be unsustainable in the longer term.7.     While we have made significant progress in tackling some of these issues, such as in our community health programmes, we can do more as an entire system. I am heartened to know that this year’s Congress will be looking into transformative efforts, that can bring us closer to a more sustainable healthcare system and healthy population. Let me elaborate on three key areas.Innovation and digital transformation for quality care8.     First, we need to transform our healthcare system in the area of digitalisation, and leverage digital tools for care delivery. COVID-19 has accelerated this need. In response, we had to speedily put in place several applications and systems to augment our public health surveillance. For instance, the TraceTogether application enabled early identification of individuals who might have exposure to COVID-19 to prevent further transmission. The COVID-19 Vaccination Appointments System has also supported the mass roll-out of vaccination exercises across Singapore, enabling clinicians to access medical records to ascertain patients’ suitability for vaccination.9.     We also saw greater up-take of telehealth consultations. During the Circuit Breaker, the NHG provided over 42,000 tele-consultations – a 20-fold increase from 2019. This was also precipitated by time-limited extension of the CHAS Chronic subsidies and MediSave usage, covering video consultations for all chronic conditions under the Chronic Disease Management Programme. Research show that telehealth can be equivalent, and even more clinically effective at times, than conventional care delivery in specific areas. Going forward, telehealth consultations will become a definitive feature of our care delivery, complementing traditional face-to-face medical consultations.10.     Another related area is data-enabled care. To provide seamless and continued care across settings and domains, clinicians will require access to reliable data. There have been several efforts by different agencies to do this. In this regard, I would like to commend NHG‘s institutions for their efficient Command, Control and Communications systems (or “C-cube”). It has helped to smoothen out coordination of patient care across settings in meaningful ways. For example, by providing visibility on frontline operations and prompts for key decisions, such as in manpower deployment and capacity management. It has helped to weather through periods of surges due to COVID-19. As our healthcare needs evolve, our investments in digitalisation for clinical care need to grow in tandem.Strengthening our social compact to address health inequalities 11.     Second, as I mentioned earlier, our healthcare system is a core part of our enabling Social Compact in Singapore. Our success as a nation in overcoming future pandemics and health crises, rests not only on the resilience of our healthcare systems, but also the togetherness of our nation. COVID-19 has heightened the awareness that everyone has a role to play in achieving good health and well-being. Since last year, individuals took efforts to observe Safe Management Measures to stay well. Different parts of the community stepped up, to support each other and those who were vulnerable. This is the Singapore spirit.12.     We have seen how the pandemic has affected various groups in society, especially the vulnerable. Research have also shown that the Social Determinants of Health, such as social, economic and environmental factors, can influence up to 80% of health outcomes. If we want to achieve and sustain a healthy population, we need to continually strengthen and sustain an enabling Social Compact. We can contribute to this national goal, as one healthcare family, through closer social-health integration.13.     I will share one tangible example of how we have done so, through Community Link (or ComLink), which MSF leads. We started ComLink to provide more holistic support for families with children living in rental housing, serving 14,000 families over the next two years. It is different from our typical ways of programming. Through ComLink, we unite the various partner organisations in the community and volunteers, to work with us to achieve holistic outcomes for the family, like stability, self-reliance and social mobility. These tend to be cross-cutting and cannot be addressed by one agency or organisation alone. Hence the need for back-end coordination. In essence, ComLink shifts the design approach from being one run by multi-agency programmes to being client-centric. So I am glad that since healthcare too, is a key need of these families, our Regional Health Systems are involved with this effort – specifically the Woodlands Health Campus. They have partnered MSF on a social-health integration pilot to address the health needs of families through ComLink Marsiling in a holistic manner. I look forward to further collaborations between the health and social sectors, as we continue to strengthen and sustain our Social Compact.Achieving good health in the new normal14.     Third, prevention is the best medicine. The pandemic has led to a rise in obesity and physical inactivity in the population. These are known risk factors for chronic conditions, such as diabetes, hypertension and high blood cholesterol levels. We can reduce our risk of these chronic diseases through healthy habits and health screenings.15.     There is also emerging evidence supporting the need to go further upstream, as early as during preconception, to promote population health. This is important, as we want to give every Singaporean child the best start in life, and to provide an enriching environment, where they can flourish and achieve their fullest potential.16.     To this end, we have set up the Interagency Taskforce on Child and Maternal Health and Well-being. One goal is to see how evidence can be translated into tangible policies and programmes to achieve better health outcomes for our young. I am glad that NHG has worked with MOE to roll out the Living Well@School pilot. Under this programme, parents and teachers are co-opted as partners and role models to enable our primary school students to embrace healthy living early in life.Closing17.     In closing, let us press on ahead, as one healthcare family and one nation, as we journey towards a COVID-resilient Singapore. To tackle the challenges beyond COVID-19, we must also continue to transform our healthcare systems, strengthen social-health integration, and address problems upstream. This will put us on a path of building a more sustainable healthcare system and healthy population for generations to come. This requires a collective effort, from all parts of society and the healthcare system. I wish all of you an enriching and meaningful Congress ahead. Thank you.  ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/keynote-address-by-mr-masagos-zulkifli-minister-for-social-and-family-development-and-second-minsiter-for-health-at-the-singapore-health-and-biomedical-congress,
SGP,Asia,Singapore,8/10/2021,120454,3590,3003.429,142,6,5.571,22087.062,658.281,550.724,Update On Hospitals’ Capacity and Manpower Situation In Managing the Covid-19 Surge,"The Ministry of Health (MOH) continues to support our hospitals to expand bed and manpower capacity and to stand up more COVID-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs), in order to handle the larger number of community cases. This will allow us to stay on course in the Stabilisation Phase to achieve COVID-19 resiliency as a nation.2. Community infections have been around 3,000 a day for the past few days.  The doubling time has slowed, from 6 to 8 days three weeks ago to about 10 to 12 days now. Nevertheless, the large daily numbers have placed significant strain on our healthcare system. Our healthcare workers – who have now been stretched for almost two years – are bearing the brunt of the burden. If not for our high vaccination rates, the workload of our healthcare workers would have been many times heavier.Update on the Hospital Situation3. The majority of COVID-19 patients (98.4%) continue to be asymptomatic or report mild symptoms. Only a small percentage require oxygen supplementation in a hospital (1.3%) or intensive care unit (ICU) care (0.1%). Currently, around 7% of COVID-19 patients are admitted into hospitals because of more severe symptoms or pre-existing medical risks which require close observation. As a result, about 20% of hospital beds in acute and community public hospitals are taken up by COVID-19 patients.4. ICU beds are disproportionately occupied by seniors 60 years and older who are unvaccinated or only partially vaccinated. They represent 1.5% of our total population, but currently account for two-thirds of the patients requiring ICU care.  The occupancy of critically ill cases in ICU was 23.5% yesterday. 5. The occupancy for COVID-19 isolation beds has risen from 62% in July 2021 to 85% for October 2021, despite our efforts to set aside more beds. Over the past three months, the number of patients seeking medical attention at the Emergency Departments (EDs) after testing positive for COVID-19 has increased by eight times. Many of them were admitted, mostly for precautionary observation.6. Consequently, the waiting time at public hospitals from the EDs to admission for non-COVID patients has increased by 34% from July 2021 to September 2021. This is in part due to the lower number of beds now available for non-COVID patients.Continued Efforts to Ramp Up Bed Capacity and Healthcare Manpower7. To cope with the increase in cases, MOH has been proactively working with public, community and private hospitals to set aside more beds for COVID-19 patients. The number of COVID-19 beds has increased from 900 to 2,500 over the last three months. Of these, about 170 are ICU beds, and another 100 can be stood up to handle ICU cases at short notice. At the same time, hospitals have been asked to prioritise resources for COVID-19 patients by reducing less urgent surgeries and appointments. Our hospitals have thus cut down on non-urgent and non-life threatening care, deferring about 20% of their total regular load, to alleviate the pressure on their capacity and manpower.8. A key resource constraint we now face is our healthcare manpower. Our public healthcare institutions and private healthcare providers have redeployed existing staff and recruited additional short-term manpower to ramp-up beds. We are also bringing in more manpower by reaching out to individuals registered with the Singapore Healthcare Corps, including both healthcare professionals and laypersons. We have also approached nurses who are registered with the Singapore Nursing Board but who are currently not in active practice.9. The response has been encouraging. About 900 individuals of all ages have stepped forward in response to our call to duty. We are progressively referring them to the public hospitals to match them with suitable roles, based on the institution’s needs and the individual’s experience and availability. The possible deployments vary across institutions and care settings, and include being deployed to the additional COVID-19 facilities that we have stood up, such as the CTFs.10. We thank all who have signed up. Those who are interested can visit go.gov.sg/shc-covidops to contribute to our nation’s fight against COVID-19.Ensuring the Long Term Sustainability of the Healthcare System11. Given our high vaccination rates of over 83% who have now completed their primary series, and with over 98% of COVID-19 infected individuals recovering with no or mild symptoms, home recovery is a safe and suitable model to right-site the care management of most COVID-19 cases. Therefore the Home Recovery Programme (HRP) has become the default care management protocol for many patients.12. However, the continued rise in cases will most likely mean a correspondingly growing number of infected persons, especially among the vulnerable elderly who will need some level of hospital or CTF care. To make best use of our hospital facilities and beds, we have been admitting those who are stable but require closer monitoring (because of their advanced age or underlying medical conditions) to CTFs where their care and close monitoring needs will be better met.13. We have stood up five CTFs over the past two weeks; Bright Vision Hospital, NTUC Health Nursing Home (Tampines), Connect@Changi, Oasia Hotel@Novena and part of Yishun Community Hospital. Together, the five CTFs currently have over 1,200 beds. Private operators have been commissioned to run some of the CTFs or ramp up their existing infrastructure to be CTFs. We are on track to add on 2,500 more beds by the end of the month, bringing our total CTF capacity to 3,700 beds.14. As MOH continues to adjust our protocols and further strengthen our support for those on HRP, we strongly urge those who have non-emergency conditions to avoid seeking treatment at the hospitals and to consult their own family doctor or General Practitioner (GP) instead. Those who are asymptomatic but are concerned they may be infected with COVID-19 can perform their own ART self-test, and self-isolate for 72 hours if their ART test result is positive. This allows those with more severe illnesses and who are in need of emergency care to be attended to quickly and helps to preserve our hospital capacity for those who truly need acute hospital care.Continued Commitment to Providing Appropriate Medical Care to Patients 15. We urge Singaporeans to play your part to protect the healthcare system and help lighten the burden now placed on our healthcare workers. All of us need to be socially responsible to take care of ourselves and others around us through vaccination, regular testing and adherence to isolation protocols where needed. Continued adherence to our Safe Management Measures will also dampen the rate of transmission and keep the number of new cases at a manageable level. We urge those who are eligible for their booster vaccination dose to get it as soon as they become eligible.16. We assure all Singaporeans that everyone who requires medical care, whether for COVID-19 or other conditions, will continue to receive appropriate care even as we do our best to overcome the challenges arising from this current wave of COVID-19 infections.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/update-on-hospitals-capacity-and-manpower-situation-in-managing-the-covid-19-surge,
SGP,Asia,Singapore,9/10/2021,124157,3703,3195.857,153,11,6.571,22766.063,679.001,586.009,"Protecting the Vulnerable, Securing Our Future","       Singapore entered the Stabilisation Phase on 27 September 2021 to slow down the rate of transmission and protect our healthcare system. We have used this time to do several things. We have built up COVID-19 Treatment Facilities to complement our hospital and community care facilities. We have also bolstered manpower, employed technology, and streamlined processes for the Home Recovery Programme (HRP), which allows the majority of individuals with mild or no symptoms to recover safely in their own homes. 2.             We thank all Singapore residents for reducing their level of activity and social interactions in the past two weeks. Your efforts have helped to slow down the rise in daily cases. However, the present wave of infection has not crested, and we must be prepared for cases to continue to increase and remain high for some time.  3.             We will ride this wave while ensuring that our healthcare system is not overwhelmed. Most vaccinated persons who catch the virus have only mild or no symptoms. Children aged 12 and below generally have mild or no symptoms as well, even though they are unvaccinated. However, for seniors who are unvaccinated, they are at great risk of falling very sick if infected.  Although this group accounts for 1.5% of our population, they account for two-thirds of the individuals who need ICU care or have died.    4.             We will therefore need to expand our vaccination-differentiated safe management measures to protect the unvaccinated. We will also simplify our testing protocols to make these easier to understand and adhere to. We will extend booster vaccinations to healthcare and frontline workers, and persons in institutionalised settings, followed by all individuals aged 30 and above, to ensure continued high levels of COVID-19 immunity in the population. Updates on Local COVID-19 Situation 5.             The vast majority (98.8%) of cases continue to have mild or no symptoms. This is due to our high vaccination coverage, with 83% of the population having now completed their 2-dose regimen. Of the 423 cases with severe illness in the last two weeks, a disproportionate proportion (53.9%) were unvaccinated, and the rest were vaccinated individuals with co-morbidities.  6.             The number of persons requiring ICU is continuing to rise at the same rate as our overall case numbers, albeit with a lag. We have had 51 new cases in ICU over the past two weeks, as compared to 32 over the preceding two weeks. Although we have increased our hospital capacity, bed occupancy rates are rising, and our healthcare manpower has been stretched. Home Recovery Programme Extending the enrolment criteria 7.             Since the start of the HRP on 15 September 2021, more than 19,000 individuals have been recovering at home, of which more than 8,000 have fully recovered and been discharged. As our population has become more familiar with the HRP, and our healthcare professionals have become more experienced in handling the medical needs of those on HRP, it is timely to extend the HRP to a wider range of individuals, especially for those with mild or no symptoms. This will allow us to better prioritise healthcare resources in our hospitals to take care of the severely ill or vulnerable patients, without compromising care to those who may be younger with milder or no symptoms. 8.             We will extend home recovery to unvaccinated persons aged 12 to 49 years as the severity of illness for such younger and unvaccinated individuals is low, and it is safe for them to recover at home. Given the clinical observations to-date of vaccinated infected persons aged 70 to 79 years, and the fall risks associated with such elderly persons in an unfamiliar environment, it will also be safer for them to recover in the familiar surroundings of their home1. However, as a precaution, individuals from both groups would be assigned to a healthcare provider and should monitor their health closely, including their oxygen level, during the isolation period and consult the healthcare provider early should there be any significant deterioration in their health. 9.             We will also extend default home recovery to children aged 5 to 11 years old, as we found that COVID-19 is not a serious illness for the vast majority of them. Furthermore, parents have often requested that children be allowed to recover at home, where there are caregivers from the family.  As for children aged 1 to 4, we will continue to extend home recovery to them provided that they are first clinically assessed at the hospitals to be suitable for home recovery.  10.          The combined outcome of these changes is that from 10 October 2021, we will make HRP2 the default care arrangement for everyone, other than for the following persons:a) partially or unvaccinated individuals aged 50 years and older;b) vaccinated persons 80 years and older; andc) children aged less than 1 year, and children aged 1 to 4 years who have been assessed to be clinically unsuitable for home recovery. Please refer to Annex A for more details. 11.          Individuals who are on HRP will continue to have 24/7 access to medical support. This may be available through existing telemedicine providers as well as a strengthened network of medical support with the Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) or polyclinics who have come onboard the programme to help provide continuity of care for their patients. For non-medical assistance, individuals can reach out to the Home Recovery Buddy Hotline (6874 4939). Timed discharge from home recovery 12.          Evidence has shown that viral loads in infected individuals will decline and reach undetectable or non-infectious levels with time. This happens in vaccinated individuals and young children (even if unvaccinated) earlier than in unvaccinated individuals. Hence, COVID-19 infected individuals enrolled in the HRP will be discharged based on the time since diagnosis, without the need for further tests. 13.          For vaccinated individuals and children aged 12 years and below, the HRP isolation period will last for 10 days, while the HRP isolation period for unvaccinated individuals above the age of 12 years will last for 14 days. Thereafter, they will be provided with an electronic discharge memo upon the end of their isolation period. For simplicity, we will remove the Day 7 discharge for vaccinated person based on a PCR test that is negative or of low viral load.  Expansion of Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) Coverage14.          Epidemiological investigations have identified food and beverage (F&B) settings such as hawker centres, retail establishments, and shopping centres as settings frequently visited by a significant proportion of COVID-19 positive cases, including those who are unvaccinated, and later on fell very sick.15.          We already have vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) for dining-in at F&B establishments3. To protect the unvaccinated individuals and reduce the strain on our healthcare system, we will expand the VDS for entry into shopping malls, attractions, hawker centres, and coffee shops from 13 October 2021. Enterprises that are able to implement the expanded VDS coverage earlier are strongly encouraged to do so. Please refer to Annex B for details. 16.          The expanded VDS means that only groups of up to 2 fully vaccinated persons will be allowed to dine-in at hawker centres and coffee shops, like all other regular F&B establishments.  Individuals who do not meet the above criteria can still buy take-away food. The relevant agencies will provide more details.  17.          Similarly, under the expanded VDS coverage, only groups of up to 2 fully vaccinated persons will be allowed to enter shopping malls and attractions.  Protecting our vulnerable groups 18.          As announced on 7 October 20214, the Ministry of Education (MOE) will progressively bring Primary 1 to 6 students back to schools for face-to-face lessons from 11 October 2021 (Monday) to ensure physical schooling resumes in a safe manner. This is in line with MOE’s approach to minimise prolonged Home-based Learning (HBL) where possible, for the social-emotional well-being of students. 19.          In line with the return of students to primary schools, face-to-face lessons for students aged 12 years and below at tuition and enrichment centres, and Private Education Institutions (PEIs) may also resume from 11 October 2021, with strict Safe Management Measures in place. Nevertheless, centres and PEIs serving students aged 12 and below are still strongly encouraged to continue conducting lessons online as much as possible to protect the young. Updates to Testing Protocols 20.          The protocols and procedures for testing and isolation have been developed over the past months and became complex and difficult to understand.  We will significantly simplify these procedures.  A key move is to reserve PCR testing mainly for individuals who feel unwell and have symptoms5. Antigen rapid tests (ART) will be used for people who are well, such as for community testing and for the management of contacts of COVID-19 cases, so that we can still detect infections early and are able to exercise precaution to self-isolate early to protect ourselves and persons around us. Revised Protocols for Positive Cases 21.        The streamlined new protocols, are as follows:Protocol 1: For those who are unwell and tested positive, they should see a doctor. They will either be placed on the HRP by default, or if the home environment is not suitable, they can recover at the appropriate care facilities. They will be isolated for 10 days if they are fully vaccinated (or are young children aged 12 years or less); or isolated for 14 days if they are unvaccinated. They will be discharged after their respective isolation periods without the need for further tests at the point of discharge.  Protocol 2: For those who are well and tested positive, they should self-isolate at home for the next 72 hours. After 72 hours, they can re-test and if negative, they may exit isolation and resume normal activities. If they become unwell at any time, they should see a doctor. 22.          Previously, we differentiated contacts of COVID-19 cases into various risk levels and imposed several measures including Quarantine Orders (QO), Health Risk Alerts (HRA), and Health Risk Warnings (HRW). There will now be a single approach – a HRW that lasts seven days from the day of its issuance, that is based on ART self-testing. It will comprise the following:Protocol 3: Upon being notified of the HRW (Day 1), the person should immediately self-isolate, and test himself with an ART on the day of the HRW issuance and upload the Day 1 ART result based on the instruction in the HRW notification.  He can continue with normal activities for the day if the test is negative. For subsequent days, i.e. Day 2 to 7, the person should test ART negative on same day before going out. If the person tests positive on any of these ART tests, he should follow Protocol 2 above. On Day 7, he must test himself with an ART, and if the test is negative, there is no further need for tests after that.  Please refer to Annex C for the summary of protocols. 23.          These revised protocols will start from 11 October 2021. They mark a shift in emphasis towards personal responsibility and self-management. 24.          For those already in the system and following previous protocols, we need to make some transitional arrangements.  If you are a COVID-19 patient, you will serve out the 10-day or 14-day isolation, depending on your vaccination status. If you are currently on a quarantine order, you will no longer need an exit PCR test. If you test yourself with an ART and the result is negative, you may go out for the day. At the end of Day 7, you may exit quarantine.  In other words, you can follow Protocol 3.  25.          To provide greater support for regular self-testing at home, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be conducting another round of distribution of ART kits from 22 October to 7 December 2021, via SingPost. Each household will receive a package containing 10 ART self-test kits. Updates to Travel Protocols Changes to border measures 26.          As part of our regular review of the COVID-19 situation in countries/regions and border measures, we have updated the list of countries in the various categories and made some adjustments to the categories of some countries/ regions. Details of the updated country/region classification and their corresponding border measures may be found in Annex D  and would be effective for arrivals from 12 October 2021, 2359 hours. We will continue to adjust our border measures as the global situation evolves. Extending Vaccinated Travel Lanes 27.          On 8 September 2021, we launched the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) with Brunei and Germany to allow entry for fully vaccinated persons from these countries into Singapore for general travel.  With VTLs, we replaced SHN with a regular testing regime for lower risk countries. As of 8 October 2021, 2359 hours, of the close to 2,000 VTP holders who entered Singapore, there have only been two imported COVID-19 cases. Both were tested COVID-positive on arrival and isolated immediately. There were no imported cases detected through the post arrival tests on Days 3 and 7 in Singapore. 28.          With the experience gained from the VTLs to Brunei and Germany, we will be extending the VTLs to eight more Category II countries/regions, namely Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States for entry into Singapore from 19 October 2021. Applications for short-term visitors and Long-Term Pass Holders will commence on 12 October 2021 for travel into Singapore from 19 October 2021. 29.          We will also jointly launch VTLs with the Republic of Korea (ROK) for travel between our countries from 15 November 2021, with application for the VTP for Short Term Visitors and Long-Term Pass Holders commencing on 8 November 2021. Returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who are vaccinated will not need to apply for the VTP to travel under the VTLs. 30.          We will also be making changes to the VTL testing regime which will apply to all VTL countries. All travellers entering Singapore under the VTLs from 19 October 2021 will only be required to present a valid negative COVID-19 PCR test result taken within 48 hours before departure to Singapore and undergo an on-arrival PCR test upon arriving in Singapore. They will not be required to undergo additional PCR tests on Days 3 and 7 of their stay in Singapore. 31.          The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will provide more details separately. Expanding the Booster Vaccination Strategy 32.          On 3 October 2021, we commenced the booster programme for persons aged 50 to 59 years, in addition to those aged 60 years and above. As of 7 October 2021, almost 372,000 individuals have received their booster dose. 57% of individuals 50 to 59 years and 72% of seniors aged 60 years and above who are eligible for their booster dose have either booked an appointment or already received their booster dose. 33.          The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) has further recommended for the following persons to receive a booster dose of the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) mRNA vaccine from six months after completing their primary series of vaccinations (please refer to Annex E for more details):a. Healthcare and frontline workers,b. Persons and staff in institutionalised settings, andc. Persons aged 30 years and above. 34.          MOH has accepted EC19V’s recommendations. Our healthcare and frontline workers are more likely to come into regular contact with COVID-19 cases in the course of their work and are at greater risk of infection. Persons and staff in institutionalised settings, such as prisons and residential care facilities, live in indoor settings of increased human density which are predisposed to large outbreaks of COVID-19. Expanding the booster programme to persons aged 30 and above will also help to raise the overall level of protection in the population. 35.          From 9 October 2021, we will start offering booster vaccinations to healthcare workers, as well as frontline COVID-19 workers who have completed their primary series vaccination regimen around six months ago. We are also working with various institutions to progressively roll out booster vaccinations to eligible persons in institutionalised settings. 36.          From 9 October 2021, we will also progressively invite persons aged 30 years and above who have also completed their primary series vaccination regimen around six months ago to make an appointment for their booster dose. An SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the mobile number that they had earlier registered for their first two doses, to book an appointment on www.vaccine.gov.sg. These individuals may receive their booster dose at any vaccination centre or participating Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC). Towards a COVID-19 Resilient Singapore 37.          We are staying the course to transit towards a COVID-19 resilient nation. We will progressively re-open our society and economy, and resume travel, which is the lifeblood of our economy. But for now, the Stabilisation Phase is necessary to protect our healthcare system.  38.          We seek everyone’s cooperation to observe all safe management measures and testing protocols so that we can lower transmission risks and slow down the pace of community infections. Everyone needs to be socially responsible to take care of themselves and minimise unnecessary movement and social interactions. If you have been exposed to positive cases, please isolate yourself, test yourself regularly and seek medical treatment if you have any symptoms. Vaccination boosters will also be a key enabler for us to protect ourselves and our loved ones, particularly our seniors. Hence, we urge everyone to be vaccinated when it is offered to you. MINISTRY OF HEALTH9 OCTOBER 2021[1] This will commence from 16 October 2021.[2] Previous eligibility criteria for HRP: (a) fully vaccinated, (b) aged 12-69 years old, (c) mild or no symptoms, (d) no severe comorbidities or illnesses, (e) household members do not include elderly who are more than 80 years old or people in the vulnerable group, such as pregnant women or those with weakened immune response or multiple comorbidities and (f) can self-isolate in a room, preferably with an attached bathroom.[3] Under the current VDS, groups of up to 2 fully vaccinated persons are allowed to dine-in.

The fall in the number of cases today is likely due to fewer swabs being done over the weekend at Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) and polyclinics, and is not indicative that the epidemic curve is bending.   Situation update1. Over the last 28 days, 98.5% of local infected cases were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, 1.2% required oxygen supplementation, and 0.1% had been in the ICU. Amongst those who required oxygen supplementation and ICU, 48.8% were fully vaccinated and 51.2% were unvaccinated/ partially vaccinated. Figure 1: Local Cases in the Last 28 Days by Severity of Condition1  2. 9 more cases have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.2 Of these, 8 were male Singaporeans and 1 was a female Singaporean, aged between 70 and 88 years. Amongst them, 4 had been unvaccinated against COVID-19, 3 had been partially vaccinated and 2 had been vaccinated. All of them had various underlying medical conditions. 3. Amongst those who have passed away over the last 28 days, 29.8% were fully vaccinated and 70.2% were unvaccinated/ partially vaccinated.Figure 2: Deaths and Active Cases in ICU, Requiring Oxygen Supplementation or Hospitalised, by Age Groups4.

As of 9 October 2021, 83% of our population has completed their full regimen/ received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 85% has received at least one dose. 6. We have administered a total of 9,426,896 doses of COVID-19 vaccines under the national vaccination programme (Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty and Moderna). In total, 4,601,688 individuals have received at least one dose of vaccine under the national vaccination programme, and 4,541,733 individuals having completed the full vaccination regimen. In addition, 212,622 doses of other vaccines recognised in the World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) have been administered, covering 112,381 individuals.7. To date, we have invited about 600,000 eligible individuals to receive their booster doses. 411,447 individuals have received their booster shots and another 74,000 have booked their appointments. Active clusters under close monitoring8.

Many countries have gone through massive waves of infections and incurred many tragic deaths, with their hospitals coming under immense pressure and even overwhelmed.3.     In Singapore, we have averted that so far, because of our strict controls throughout the large parts of the past 20 months. With the great majority of our population now fully vaccinated, the disease is no longer life threatening for the vast majority of us, and we will have to start transiting to living with COVID-19 and restoring our normal lives.4.     Even then, in recent weeks, infection numbers have shot up, and unfortunately, so did patients who succumbed. To those who suffered the loss of a loved one, please accept our condolences. To the healthcare workers who hold the fort at the last line of defence in our clinics and hospitals, let’s give them whatever support we can.5.     At the Ministry of Health (MOH), we are mobilising more manpower resources, such as from PCR swab operations which we are doing less of. We have 1,600 trained volunteers who have stepped forward to help, and we have deployed them.6.     We have simplified healthcare protocols, so hopefully the days of healthcare workers being regularly quarantined due to exposure to infected persons are behind us. We are also roping in private sector hospitals to help share the load and the burden.7.     The path Singapore has chosen is unique in the world – we did not take a purist ‘zero COVID’ or ‘living with COVID’ approach. We adopted an eradication strategy when our population was vulnerable, mainly last year and earlier part of this year. After vaccines have given us a protective shield, we are opening up progressively, and avoiding a sudden lifting of all restrictions. Some may feel that this middle of the road approach is perhaps unclear, and may even appear to be a ‘flip-flop’. But it has helped us avert the massive deaths that many countries have suffered. It is the correct approach for Singapore, and day by day, we are moving closer to the light at the end of tunnel.8.     I must also thank all the officers at the MOH and our partners managing the COVID-19 operations. This include contact tracing, conveyancing of patients, and also those running the Home Recovery Programme.9.     They are in turn supported by HealthTech professionals and clinical informaticians, who equipped our operations with the right IT tools, systems and infrastructure. You play such a critical role but all the way in the background. I thought this event is a good occasion to recognise your quiet but decisive contribution. Thank you.Potential of Digital Transformation 10.     Today, let me talk about the importance of digital technology. It has disrupted many industries, such as telecommunications and entertainment, where the digital medium has displaced the analogue.11.     But as time goes by, digital technology redefines operations and drives everything we do, just like the IT systems at the heart of our COVID-19 operations. So industries from retail, hotels, taxis, and travel, to security, education and financial services are all being redefined.12.     Healthcare will not be an exception. The revolution is happening at many levels. In research and development, medical science and IT inevitably converge, when we realised that the basic building blocks of living organisms are lines of nucleotide source codes. This in turn propelled the development of mRNA vaccines over the last 30 years. COVID-19 brought about a further breakthrough, as BioNTech and Moderna took less than a year to develop their mRNA vaccines against COVID-19.13.     An equally disruptive change is happening at the level of healthcare delivery. It will change the way we look after our own health and disrupt care models. The information highway enables functions such as reading of X-rays to be outsourced. Telemedicine is becoming more commonplace.14.     Social media sites have been using data generated in a person’s life-course to nudge you to buy things and watch video clips. That AI technology is now being used to nudge you to do something good for your health, to fob off serious disease in the future.15.     The convergence of digital technology and healthcare can and will be a huge contribution to humankind. Healthcare will increasingly live up to its name – to enhance health, rather than just to treat sickness.16.     However, I do not think the digital disruption to healthcare will happen as quickly and as sudden as other industries. Why? In entertainment for example, if I can pay a monthly subscription so that I can access thousands of movies and shows streamed through my device or TV, I will not want to own a DVD or a video cassette player. The value proposition is obvious, and the change in market demand will be decisive and immediate.17.     Healthcare is much more complex. As consumers, we need to be confident that any alternate care model is good for ourselves and our loved ones. When we are ill, we may want second, third opinions from doctors. We are a lot more sensitive with our healthcare data, than with the data such as our browsing history. Governments want to be assured of public safety and efficacy of all treatments. Insurers will want a say as they are a major payor of medical bills.18.     There are therefore significant policy, regulatory, public confidence, market and commercial issues to be addressed, before digital technology can be fully harnessed to transform and improve healthcare systems around the world. So today, let me briefly talk about three matters of public policy that need to be addressed.Addressing the Public Policy Concerns19.     First is the policy on population health. As population ages, societies increasingly realise the need to shift the centre of gravity of disease management away from acute hospitals, to the community.20.     The management of chronic illnesses in particular, should be preventive, and done at the primary care level. Because by the time a patient has severe chronic illnesses and need acute hospital care, it is too late, too expensive and too big a burden to his or her family.21.     This is a conceptually very sound approach, but it requires the Government to rethink its approach to design and resource the healthcare ecosystem. It also means that patient care will need to be carried out seamlessly across different settings, in the community as well as institutions, in social agencies and also in hospitals.22.     And in preventive care, we will need more than medical information. We also need timely and sufficient data of the wider determinants of health, such as lifestyles, home and work environments, so that we can design the right interventions ahead of time.23.    A population health strategy will require the right information-sharing infrastructure. This leads to the second area of concern, which is the healthcare IT infrastructure.24.     The challenges to healthcare data sharing are significant. There are legacy IT infrastructure issues, which led to data remaining siloed within individual healthcare organisations, unable to interoperate. This happens in every country in the world.25.     In Singapore, we recognised back in 2011 the need to bring together and share clinical summary records from different healthcare providers, so that they can deliver safer and better, integrated care for patients. We therefore introduced the National Electronic Health Records (NEHR) with the vision of “One Patient, One Health Record”.26.     So today, we have a technical and system solution to break down the information silos across care providers and settings. Participation is mostly from public healthcare institutions, with some private healthcare providers involved as well.27.     We are working to enhance this current IT infrastructure. Beyond summary records, the sharing of care teams’ assessments and patients’ care plans will enable a common understanding of the condition and the needs of the patient. This will enhance patient care.28.     Beyond sharing information between care providers only, we are using apps to allow patients to also take ownership of their own care, through adopting healthier lifestyles, having ready access to their own health information, and generating personal information to share with their care providers.29.     This leads to the third issue, which is data privacy. Notwithstanding the benefits I just mentioned, as patients, we can be sensitive about personal health information.30.     We do not want it to be used like our contact numbers, email addresses or browsing histories, for purposes of marketing and advertising. When that happens, we may change our phone numbers, or our credit card number if someone tries to cheat us.31.     But healthcare information is different – our medical history is intrinsic to us. We cannot just change that, they are factual. There has therefore been a longstanding ethos in the health profession to treat patient data with confidentiality, in order to maintain trust in the individual doctor-patient relationship, and the social compact.32.     It is therefore important to respect the sensitivity of health information. In the US and the EU, there are laws that specifically protect health information from being shared without the consent of the individual. In Singapore, we have in place a general data protection and privacy regime that has worked well for most types of data.33.     However, with the advent of digital technology, there are also immense opportunities and public good in ensuring health information of patients can be shared across healthcare institutions and settings, so that we can enhance health, improve care, advance medical science, and ultimately, save lives.34.     A mindset of absolute medical confidentiality is no longer suitable. We need to develop our policies and regulations on sharing personal health information, in a controlled way that serves the noble objectives of better healthcare, but prevents misuse. A new balance is required.Conclusion 35.     What I have raised are some of the immediate policy-related concerns as we seek to harness digital technology to improve the health of our population. It is one aspect of this exciting universe of opportunities. The pandemic has made some of these opportunities very evident, such as the use of telemedicine, the importance of primary and preventive care, the primacy of self-responsibility.36.     And so we are at a crossroads in the use of Healthcare IT in the digital transformation of healthcare. Much of what I have spoken about will be subject to further discussion, and I wish everyone plenty of fruitful takeaways from this Conference.

So, we have to monitor the trend over the next few days to understand the trajectory of the transmission. §  The important thing is: It is no longer doubling every few days like what we have seen in late September and early October. §  But the top line of infection numbers is actually less important.  What is critical is how the top line translates into the bottomline of how many patients fall seriously ill and need hospital or ICU care, or die. o   That leads me to the second positive, which is that there is now a higher percentage of infected persons with no symptoms or mild symptoms. §  This percentage used to be 98%. It has now risen progressively, and over the past 28 days, the percentage is now 98.6%. The remaining 1.1% need O2 supplementation, 0.1% need ICU care. §  So a smaller percentage of patients are becoming severely ill. And that is a positive trend. o   Third, amongst seniors 60 and above who are vaccinated, the number getting infected has been falling. §  At its peak in early October, 1,000 vaccinated seniors were infected in a day. §  Yesterday, this has fallen to 279. §  We think this is a combination of a few factors. One, seniors are cutting back on their social activities. Second, which I think is a major factor, is because of the boosters they have been receiving, which is fobbing off infections. ·      On the negative side: o   First, there is still no sign of cases falling. This will take time.  As more people get boosted, as individuals who are vaccinated catch the virus and experience only mild flu-like symptoms, the antibodies and the immunity in our society will build up over time. §  When that happens, we will see cases falling and we can open up social and economic activities without cases rising rapidly. §  And then, we would have achieved a new equilibrium with the virus. And that is what we are working towards. o   Second, our hospitals and healthcare workers continue to come under tremendous pressure. §  Our 2,000 isolated rooms are 81% filled.  Queues have formed for COVID-19 and non-COVID patients needing hospital beds in certain hospitals. §  We have stood up 207 ICU beds. 71 are occupied by patients who are intubated, that means they need ventilators to help them breathe. §  They stay an average of 15 days, but the longest they stay, up to a month. §  There are another 75 who are not intubated but have been admitted to ICU because they require close monitoring and treatment by ICU-trained healthcare workers, to prevent further deterioration. §  So, the workload on healthcare workers and hospitals is therefore very significant. o   Third, the number of infections amongst unvaccinated seniors aged 60 and above continues to be high. So, this is in contrast to vaccinated seniors where the numbers are falling, but for unvaccinated seniors, the infection numbers continue to be high. §  They account for two-thirds of patients in ICU and who have died. §  Over the past 5 days, the number of infections amongst this group averaged 127 per day. §  For them, the disease is not 98.6% mild. §  For unvaccinated seniors in their 60s, our data showed 1 in 4 will require oxygen, ICU care or will succumb. The risk goes up to 1 in 3 for those in their 70s, and almost 1 in 2 for those in their 80s or older. §  Once an unvaccinated senior is on oxygen, more than 1 in 5 or more will go on to need ICU care or die. §  So I hope with the vaccination-differentiated measures implemented recently, it will bring this number of infections of unvaccinated seniors down. §  But hospitals are bracing themselves for a sustained, heavy patient load. ·      MOH is doing whatever we can to support and bolster the hospitals. o   If need be, we will open up more ICU beds, the next leap would be to 300 beds, but that will be at the expense of further degradation of normal service and normal medical care. o   We are beefing up manpower, through redeployment, using former swabbers as patient care and healthcare assistants, tapping on the help of the SG Healthcare Corps, where 2,000 people have signed up and about 800 are ready for deployment. o   Our hospitals and healthcare workers will need the help from the rest of Singapore, to keep caseloads steady, and not overwhelm the system, so that we can continue to do our best to give proper medical care to all patients, COVID-19 and non-COVID.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/opening-remarks-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-covid-19-multi-ministry-taskforce-doorstop-interview-on-20-october-2021,

This will protect healthcare capacity and vulnerable seniors during this period when COVID-19 cases in the community are rising. 2.             MOH had earlier announced the suspension of in-person visits to hospitals till 23 October 2021 (inclusive), as well as to residential care homes until 24 October 2021 (inclusive). In the past two weeks, the rise in COVID-19 cases in the community has increased COVID-19 admissions to the hospitals. There were also several new COVID-19 clusters amongst patients and residents in the hospitals and residential care homes. To protect healthcare capacity during this period, as well as care homes residents who are more vulnerable, in-person visits to hospitals and residential care homes will continue to be suspended. 3.     Concurrently, booster vaccination has been ramped up for healthcare workers and seniors, including those residing in residential care homes, to mitigate the risk of large outbreaks in the hospitals and residential care homes.  In-person Visits at Hospitals 4.             During the suspension of in-person visits to all hospital wards, the following patient groups will continue to be allowed visitors on a case-by case basis, as assessed by the hospitals: a.             Patients who are in critical condition;b.             Paediatric patients;c.              Birthing/post-partum mothers; andd.              Patients requiring additional care support from caregivers. Examples of caregivers include those providing assistance to inpatients who have mental incapacities or family members who are undergoing caregiver training to better care for their loved ones after hospital discharge. 5.             The above patient groups would be allowed only one pre-designated visitor, with one visit per day. Patients who are in critical condition may be allowed up to five pre-designated visitors, with a maximum of two visitors at the patient’s bedside at any one time. 6.             All visitors to hospital wards during this period will need to produce a valid negative antigen rapid test (ART) result obtained within the last 24 hours of each visit, as administered or supervised by MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers (including tests performed at Quick Test Centres). This is a mandatory requirement for all visitors regardless of vaccination status, except for persons who have recovered from COVID-19 and are able to present a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) exemption notice2. 7.             All visitors approved to enter hospital wards must don face masks with good filtration capability at all times. These include surgical masks and reusable masks that are made of two layers of fabrics. Visitors are reminded not to eat or drink in the hospital wards, or use the patients’ toilets in the wards. They should also avoid sitting on patients’ beds. In-person visits at Residential Care Homes 8.             During the period where in-person visits are suspended, residential care homes have the discretion to allow visits for exceptional cases, for example if the resident is critically ill. These visitors would be subject to visitor management measures as advised by the residential care homes. 9.             Residential care homes would also be focusing on rolling out booster vaccinations for their residents during this period. As residents of care homes tend to be more susceptible to severe illness if infected, we strongly encourage all next-of-kin of residents to support their loved ones in getting vaccinated and/or receiving their booster dose once eligible. This would ensure that they have a high level of immunity and are protected from severe disease. Safeguarding the Well-being of Our Patients/Residents 10.          To ensure that patients/residents remain connected with their loved ones, the hospitals and residential care homes will continue to support alternative methods of communication such as through telephone or video calls. 11.          MOH will review and calibrate these measures regularly in line with the evolving situation. We seek the understanding and cooperation of patients/residents, and their family members and loved ones as we work to safeguard them and the staff to reduce the risk of COVID-19 importation and transmission in our healthcare institutions and residential care facilities.MINISTRY OF HEALTH21 October 2021[1] Includes public acute hospitals, community hospitals and private hospitals[2] Recovered individuals (within last 270 days) can obtain a PET Exemption Notice from any clinic offering ART or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing services.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/extension-of-the-suspension-of-in-person-visits-to-hospitals-and-residential-care-homes,

However, varying effectiveness was observed in a range of different studies. There is also no comprehensive data on its protection against the Delta variant. Furthermore, antibody levels after vaccination were low and declined rapidly within three to six months after completion the 2nd dose returning to pre-vaccination levels by six months.5.      While Sinovac did not apply to HSA for PSAR authorisation of a 3-dose regimen for its Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, there is evidence that a third dose of the vaccine is needed at three to six months after the second dose to raise antibody levels. This is consistent with the World Health Organisation Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) recommendation of a third dose for those aged 60 and above for the primary vaccination series.6.      The Expert Committee also notes that as at 23 October 2021, more than 84% of our total population has received at least one dose of the PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccines which have been the mainstay of our National Vaccination Programme.7.      In view of the lower efficacy of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine as compared to the PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccines and the lack of data on the efficacy of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine against the Delta variant, the Expert Committee recommends that persons who are unable to complete the full two-dose regime of the PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccines, due to valid medical reasons, should receive the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine. This includes those who have taken their first dose of one of the PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccines and developed myocarditis or allergies to the mRNA vaccines, as well as those who have a past history of allergy to a component in the mRNA vaccines.8.      The PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccines remain the recommended COVID-19 vaccines for all persons who are eligible, given the higher vaccine effectiveness against infection and severe disease, including against the Delta variant. Taking the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine will allow those who are medically unable to complete their primary vaccination using mRNA vaccines, to be protected against COVID-19, and to be considered fully vaccinated.9.      Given the circumstances aforementioned, persons of all ages who are eligible to receive the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine are recommended to receive three doses of the vaccine as their primary vaccination series. The second dose should be taken 28 days after the first dose, while the third dose should be taken 90 days after the second dose. The recommended timing of the third dose corresponds to when antibody levels are known to have declined. Persons who have received two doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine but are able to receive the PSAR mRNA vaccines, are strongly recommended to take one of the mRNA vaccines for the third dose of their primary vaccination series. Please refer to the Annex for further details on the recommended use of the vaccine under different circumstances.10.     The Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine is not recommended for use as a booster vaccination, except in persons who are unable – for medical reasons – to receive a third dose of the mRNA vaccine. Persons who have completed two doses of the mRNA vaccine without allergies or severe adverse events, are recommended to receive an mRNA vaccine instead of the Sinovac-Coronavac vaccine, if they are eligible for a booster.11.     There has been similar evidence that antibody levels from the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine also decline after two doses, and a third dose increases this substantially. The Expert Committee notes that some individuals have opted for Sinopharm BIBP under the Special Access Route (SAR) as their primary series vaccination despite the PSAR mRNA vaccines being strongly recommended for them. They are strongly recommended to take one of the PSAR mRNA vaccines for the third dose of their primary series vaccination. If they decline, a third dose of the Sinopharm BIBP vaccine, is recommended, to be given at three months after the second dose to complete their primary vaccination series.12.     Separately, local and international safety data now indicate more clearly that persons with severe allergies to non-COVID-19 vaccines can be safely vaccinated with mRNA vaccines. These persons were previously required to undergo a review by a specialist before vaccination. Given the greater assurance of safety that we now have, based on global and local data, persons with severe allergies to other non-COVID-19 vaccines can now receive the mRNA vaccine without being reviewed by a specialist. Persons with documented allergy to PEG, which is a component of mRNA vaccines, continue to be ineligible for the mRNA vaccines.13.     The Expert Committee will continue to monitor and review the use of COVID-19 vaccines in Singapore as more data becomes available over time, and update our recommendations as necessary. A high local vaccination coverage is key to protect ourselves from COVID-19, and we encourage all medically eligible persons to be vaccinated.EXPERT COMMITTEE ON COVID-19 VACCINATION23 OCTOBER 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/expert-committee-on-covid-19-vaccination-updated-recommendation-on-use-of-covid-19-vaccines,

The Ministry of Health (MOH) and Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) advise members of the public to activate 995 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) only for life-threatening emergencies.2. Between 15 and 21 October 2021, SCDF 995 Operations Centre received about 5,500 calls for medical assistance. Approximately 20% of the calls were from COVID-19 patients. They were conveyed to the nearest Emergency Department (ED). Of these COVID-19 patients conveyed to the ED, about 47% received only day treatment at the ED and did not need to be hospitalised. Additionally, 15% were warded for 2 days or less, and mainly for observation.3. SCDF 995 EMS caters to the conveyance of both COVID-19 and non-COVID patients who suffer from life threatening and emergency conditions.1  4. To ensure that the 995 EMS is able to provide responsive conveyance for those with emergency conditions, we advise individuals who are not experiencing life-threatening emergencies to refrain from calling 995.5. Individuals who have tested positive in their polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and are recovering at home under the Home Recovery Programme or awaiting conveyance to a care or isolation facility, but who are experiencing only mild symptoms, are advised to seek medical help via the following channels:a. A telemedicine provider (go.gov.sg/telemedicineproviders); b. Their regular primary care provider; orc. The HR Buddy hotline (6874 4939).6. Those who have tested positive in their Antigen Rapid Test (ART) and are feeling unwell or experiencing symptoms such as fever or persistent cough should visit a Public Health Preparedness Clinic (PHPC) (https://flu.gowhere.gov.sg) via private transport for medical attention.7. As we learn to live with COVID-19, appropriate activation of 995 EMS and use of ED services is important.

The World Health Organization's (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation (SAGE) provided guidance on 21 October 2021, that a third dose of Sinovac-CoronaVac should be administered between three to six months after the second dose. Priority should go to older adults and immunocompromised persons, and the third dose may be required for populations where the immune response following the standard primary series is deemed likely to be insufficient. SAGE further noted that if more than six months have elapsed since the second dose, the third dose should be administered as soon as possible. In addition, several countries, including Malaysia, Chile, Brazil and also China have also started to offer a third vaccine dose to persons who have received their first two doses six months ago, including persons aged below 60 years of age. SAGE’s recommendation was made based on studies that show that antibody levels after vaccination with Sinovac-CoronaVac decline rapidly after three months, and to pre-vaccination levels by six months. This occurs in both younger and older adults.  However, other studies showed that a third dose will raise the antibody levels to multiple folds higher than those observed after the second dose, and will give protection against severe illness and deaths if infected with COVID-19. Given international evidence, and WHO SAGE’s guidance, the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has recommended for a three-dose regime for the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine for all age groups.

I’d like to make two points. 2.     First, globalisation is not just a buzz word, but it describes the reality where the lives and the fates of our countries and peoples are deeply intertwined.a. And because of that we find ourselves stakeholders of global commons that we must collectively protect and preserve. b. They include freedom of navigation across the high seas and open skies, the global network of information highways, the health of our precious mother Earth, a global system of governance etc.c. COVID-19 has highlighted another important global commons – which is humankind’s resilience against pandemics. d. There will be future pandemics after COVID-19, which will require a strong global response, with an adequately resourced and independent WHO at the centre of the effort.  3.     This brings me to my second point. We must recognise the importance of pandemic response. We need to do something about it, for the sake of better protecting humankind, and for our future generations. a. We need to address the significant financing gaps to make a global response effective, and even possible.b. We also need to address the gaps in capability and non-financial resources.c. For example, COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics (VTDs) are essential to secure public health, save lives, and safeguard livelihoods by preventing infections and severe disease.d. We need to be able to develop and distribute VTDs safely and reliably across the world.e. We need to establish a robust global network of regional vaccine manufacturing hubs. f. We need to channel resources to those who are most in need of help. g. We need health and finance ministers to work closely together, and in Singapore, the Health and Finance Ministers chair the Multi-Ministry Taskforce in combating COVID-19.h. And we need to continue our progress to develop the global pandemic response system.4.     Singapore looks forward to furthering discussions on bolstering multilateralism and bilateral initiatives.5.     Let me now hand the floor to the Singapore Minister for Finance.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/intervention-for-g20-joint-finance-and-health-ministers-meeting-2021,
SGP,Asia,Singapore,30/10/2021,195211,3112,3707.143,394,14,13.429,35794.888,570.632,679.761,"Updates On Expanded Vaccination Programme, Facilitating Our Vaccination Booster Programme","The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 23 October 2021 that the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine would be included in the National Vaccination Programme (NVP). From 30 October 2021, individuals can make appointments to receive vaccination at the Raffles City Convention Centre for their vaccinations. Seniors aged 60 years and above can walk in. This will greatly expand capacity on top of the private clinics and public healthcare institutions that administer the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine on behalf of the Ministry of Health (MOH).2. Our study has shown that boosters confer significant additional protection against COVID-19 infection and severe illness.  When compared with persons eligible for the booster but who have not yet received it, the booster further reduces the risk of COVID-19 infection by around 70%, and the risk of severe infections by around 90%. Such protection is on top of the protection that the initial two doses of mRNA vaccines under the NVP already provide against COVID-19.  3. As we have assessed that there is sufficient capacity at the Moderna Vaccination Centres to accommodate walk-ins, there is an opportunity for us to accelerate our booster programme and make it more convenient for individuals to get their booster dose more quickly. From 1 November 2021, we will allow all individuals aged 30 years old and above to walk in to any of the Moderna Vaccination Centres for their booster dose. We encourage all who are eligible but have not taken their booster dose to come forward for it. This is the best protection for you and your loved ones as we journey towards living with COVID-19.Booking Appointments for Sinovac-CoronaVac Vaccinations4. The MTF announced on 23 October 2021 that the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine would be included in the NVP for those aged 18 years and above and who are unable to be vaccinated with mRNA vaccines. This followed the Health Sciences Authority’s (HSA) interim authorisation of the vaccine under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR). The vaccination will be free of charge and covered by the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination (VIFAP).5. Eligible individuals may take the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine from 30 October 2021. Persons who want to take the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine may make their appointments in the following ways: a) Persons who have yet to take a dose of any COVID-19 vaccine and wish to take the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine may register their interest at www.vaccine.gov.sg from 30 October 2021. Once registered, an SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the mobile number used to register interest, and individuals may use the link to make an appointment at the vaccination centre at Raffles City Convention Centre (RCCC) or at any of the 11 Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) offering Sinovac-CoronaVac (see Annex A).b) Persons who have taken at least one dose of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine at a Special Access Route (SAR) authorised private clinic previously can continue to take the remaining dose(s) of their three-dose regime at any of the PSAR-authorised private clinics (see Annex B). They may proceed to book their remaining appointments at these clinics from 1 November 2021, if they have not already done so. The list of PSAR-authorised private clinics will be updated on www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations.c) Persons who were medically ineligible for a two-dose mRNA vaccine regime and previously invited to receive the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine under a special public health programme, should follow the instructions provided in their SMS invitation to continue with their regime. d) Seniors aged 60 years and above who belong to any of the above groups may also walk into the vaccination centre at RCCC to receive their Sinovac-CoronaVac doses, from 31 October 2021, without the need to register for interest or make an appointment. Preliminary Local Findings on Effectiveness of Vaccination Booster 6. The Vaccination Booster Programme started on 14 September 2021. Since then, we have seen a healthy take up of booster doses among those eligible to receive them. As of 27 October, amongst those invited to take boosters, 80.2% of those aged 60 years and above, 92.7% of those aged 50 to 59 years, and 75.1% of those aged 30 to 49 years have received their booster dose or booked an appointment. 7. MOH has studied the COVID-19 positive infection rates of individuals who have received their booster doses vis-à-vis fully vaccinated individuals who have not yet received their booster doses. 685,083 fully vaccinated seniors above the age of 60 years who were eligible for the booster doses were included in this study. These individuals had received their second vaccination dose more than 180 days before 15 September 2021. They were tracked for their booster doses, whether there are confirmed COVID-19 infections, and if yes, severity of COVID-19 cases.  The tracking was done between 15 September to 22 October 2021.8. After adjusting for age, gender and other differences, we found that booster doses confer around a further 70% risk reduction against COVID-19 infections, and 90% risk reduction against severe infections, as compared to those who have received only two doses to date at around the same period as those who had received their boosters. Hence there is significant protection accorded by boosters on top of the protection that two doses of mRNA vaccines already provide against COVID-19 – i.e., on top of the vaccine effectiveness of 40% to 60% against infection, when comparing vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals, and more than 90% against severe illness.  9. Therefore comparing individuals who are fully vaccinated and boosted, versus unvaccinated individuals, estimates combining data from different sources are that the former benefits from vaccine effectiveness of about 80% or more against COVID-19 infection, and about 99% against severe illness. Walk-In for Moderna Booster Dose for all, from 1 November10. The preliminary findings support facilitating access to our booster vaccination programme to enhance protection against COVID-19 infection and ensure continued excellent protection against severe illness. This is the best way to keep Singaporeans safe. We thank everyone who has come forward for their booster dose, and urge those who are eligible, but have not yet taken their booster dose, to do so.11. Persons who are recommended to receive a booster vaccination can choose either the Pfizer-BioNTech/COMIRNATY vaccine or the Moderna vaccine, and they need not receive the same vaccine they had received for their previous two doses. As we had started our NVP with only the Pfizer-BioNTech/ COMIRNATY available to us, there are many more among us who had taken two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech/ COMIRNATY as their primary series vaccination regime. These persons who had taken the Pfizer-BioNTech/ COMIRNATY vaccine can take the Moderna vaccine for their booster dose.12. Currently, seniors aged 60 years and above may already walk into any vaccination site without appointment to receive their booster dose. From 1 November 2021, all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents, and Long-Term Pass Holders aged 30 years and above who have completed their second dose six months ago (i.e., on 1 May 2021 or earlier) may walk into any of the nine vaccination centres offering the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, without a prior appointment. This applies both to persons who may have completed their primary series vaccination regimen with the Pfizer-BioNTech/ COMIRNATY or Moderna mRNA vaccine. The vaccination centres offering the Moderna vaccine are:• Buona Vista Community Club• Hong Kah North Community Club• Kebun Baru Community Club• Potong Pasir Community Club• Punggol 21 Community Club• Radin Mas Community Club• Tampines East Community Club• Woodlands Community Club• Yew Tee Community Club13. Booster vaccination of all dormitory dwelling Migrant Workers and non-dormitory dwelling work-permit holders MWs in the Construction, Marine, Processing (CMP) sector will be scheduled by the Ministry of Manpower. 14. Vaccination remains a key enabler in our fight against COVID-19. We urge all who are eligible to come forward to receive your vaccinations, including your booster.Collective Effort to Keep Safe as We Move Towards a COVID-19 Resilient Singapore15. Learning to live with COVID-19 does not mean living life as if COVID-19 did not exist. Rather, each of us have to take the necessary actions within our control to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe. This includes going for our vaccination and booster doses, complying with safe management measures and practising social responsibility to self-test regularly, for example before visiting our family members who are seniors, or those who cannot be vaccinated, or before going into our workplaces. Individuals who are unable to take any dose of PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccines or to complete the PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccination regime due to medical reasons are encouraged to get vaccinated with Sinovac-CoronaVac.16. With the collective efforts of everyone, we can reduce the rate of COVID-19 transmission, avoid overwhelming our healthcare system, and keep Singapore safe as we navigate our path together towards COVID-19 resilience.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/updates-on-expanded-vaccination-programme-facilitating-our-vaccination-booster-programme,

SGP,Asia,Singapore,1/11/2021,200844,2470,3575.143,421,14,13.143,36827.783,452.912,655.556,"Ministerial Statement by Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Health, On Update On Icu and Hospital Capacity, 1 November 2021","1.     Mr Speaker, may I have your permission to deliver this Statement on behalf of the Minister for Health? 2.     Thank you, Sir. From today’s order paper I will address Oral Questions 1 through to 10 and Written Question 40, as well as questions filed by Ms He Ting Ru, Assoc Prof Jamus Lim, Mr Liang Eng Hwa, Mr Leong Mun Wai, Ms Mariam Jaafar, as well as Mr Murali Pillai for future sittings. Members may wish to withdraw the questions filed for future sittings if they have had their questions addressed.3.     Sir, it has been five weeks since we entered the Stabilisation Phase. We had tightened restrictions to slow the growth in the number of cases, and to further expand and stabilise our healthcare system. I would like to explain to the House the current situation in the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and Hospitals, and address questions about deaths and severe cases from COVID-19. I have been meeting the clinical teams that run the ICUs, visiting them on site to go through operational details, and speaking to their staff to understand the challenges they face. These discussions, and the insights shared, are vital in helping us plan ahead, should infection rates climb and severe cases increase.4.     As of yesterday, we have 1,672 COVID-19 patients admitted into our acute hospitals, and they take up about 18% of hospital beds in our acute public hospitals. The occupancy rate of all our general ward beds is currently at 90%. For isolation beds it is now at 85%.5.     Of the COVID-19 patients who are hospitalised, the more serious cases will need oxygen supplementation. This number of cases continues to increase, with 284 cases currently needing oxygen support in the general wards.6.     The most serious cases need ICU care. The proportion of COVID-19 cases requiring ICU care is at about 0.3% today. Even though this is still only a small proportion, it translates into a large absolute number of ICU patients when the case numbers are high, and will place a serious strain on our ICU capacity.7.     There are currently 130 patients who are critically ill, in the ICU. Some are intubated and require a mechanical ventilator. All of these patients require the continuous care of the ICU team. They occupy around 60% of the 219 ICU beds currently reserved for COVID-19 patients. These patients stay for an average of 11 to 15 days in the ICU, and some stay for up to a month in the ICU.8.     Besides COVID-19 cases, there are also non-COVID-19 patients with life-threatening medical conditions who require ICU care, adding to the sustained load that our hospitals have to bear. Our public hospitals currently operate about 163 adult ICU beds for these patients, with an average occupancy of close to 80%.9.     In comparison, in 2019, before COVID-19 struck, we had 298 adult ICU beds, and the average occupancy rate was 63%. So we have been reducing the non-COVID-19 ICU beds, in order to cope with more COVID-19 patients. This is one of the key trade-offs when we increase the number of COVID-19 ICU beds.10.     We have had to increase the total number of ICU beds to 382 for both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients over the past two months. The need to increase the capacity of our healthcare system is a heavy burden carried by the staff, our healthcare workers.The State of our Healthcare Workers11.     Already, our hospitals are feeling the manpower crunch. Signs of fatigue can be seen amongst our healthcare workers. It has been over 20 months of continuous daily battle against the pandemic. A large proportion of our healthcare workers have not had the opportunity to take leave since 2020, and over 90% of them will not be able to clear their accumulated leave for 2021. This is clearly a much higher proportion compared to the past two years. Our healthcare workers have gone and continue to go way beyond the call of duty to care for their patients. The hospitals are trying to minimise having staff work overtime. For the month of September, our nurses worked for an average of 160 to 175 hours per month.12.     I received a WhatsApp message from a senior member of the clinical teams: “We are getting increasingly stretched, overworked and fatigued. We are armed up... We are uncertain how long we can keep this up. Morale is slipping.” Another colleague sent this: “It feels like what started as a 2.4k run became a marathon, and just as we are reaching the finishing line, we have to run a second marathon. Our people are exhausted physically, mentally, emotionally – whether they will admit it or not.” I know this person as a professional colleague. Their roles to look after ICU patients also extend to looking after their staff and managing their teams, making sure that people are in the position to perform to their best. So words like this, I take it very very seriously.13.     It is therefore not surprising to find resignation rates going up this year. About 1,500 healthcare workers have resigned in the first half of 2021, compared to about 2,000 annually pre-pandemic. Foreign healthcare workers have also resigned in bigger numbers, especially when they are unable to travel to see their families back home. Close to 500 foreign doctors and nurses have resigned in the first half of 2021, as compared to around 500 in the whole of 2020 and around 600 in 2019. About double the usual rate. These resignations were mostly tendered for personal reasons, for migration, or moving back to their home countries.14.     But it is also in such trying circumstances that we find stories of inspiration, stories of commitment to public service. On a recent visit to a COVID-19 ICU, I met a nurse who had been redeployed from her usual job in the Orthopaedic Department into the COVID-19 ICU. She had had a short training and orientation course, and then subsequently on-the-job training from her ICU colleagues. She is senior, a Nurse Clinician, and an Advanced Practice Nurse, with many decades in public service. Although it is a challenge to work in a new environment, with a new set of equipment, drugs and protocols, because of her excellent fundamentals and her experience and resolve, she demonstrated confidence and competence in delivering care that ICU patients need.15.     On the day that I visited, she was looking after her first ever obstetric patient, after many years this is her first obstetric patient, a young lady who had to have her baby delivered prematurely because she had COVID19 and was now needing treatment in the ICU, not in the post-natal ward. An orthopaedic nurse, deployed to a COVID ICU, now looking after an obstetric patient. And there are many others like her, doctors, nurses, therapists, social workers - re-deployed to do what is urgently needed. And despite having to do difficult work in unfamiliar environments they have kept the clinical outcomes excellent, through hard work, professionalism, dedication and resilience.16.     But this is taking a toll. They are getting tired. They are carrying a burden of care that is sometimes unimaginable. Having to hold a phone for a patient so their family can say their last goodbyes. Holding their patient’s hand, to keep them company, on behalf of the patient’s relatives. They need all the support we can give them.17.     At MOH, we are redeploying manpower, to serve as healthcare or patient care assistants at our institutions. We are reaching out to more volunteers to join the SG Healthcare Corps and support this important work. We are collaborating with private hospitals to ease some of the load on healthcare workers in our public hospitals. We are stepping up the recruitment of healthcare workers from overseas.18.     Our public healthcare institutions have also stepped up their outreach to staff to support them through measures to safeguard their well-being. This includes providing counselling services, staff helplines, and peer support programmes.19.     To Dr Tan Wu Meng’s question about hospital departments factoring in sick leave as one of the indicators of work performance, there have previously been isolated incidents, but this practice has ceased. Healthcare workers who are concerned about the way sick leave affects their performance appraisals can approach their union, MOM or MOH for assistance.Hospital and ICU Capacity20.     Besides addressing the issues of manpower, we have also been working with public, community and private hospitals to set aside more beds for COVID-19 patients. We have also stood up COVID-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs), which have close to 2,000 beds with an occupancy of 50% or less. We are continuing to add further capacity to our CTFs, with a view to reach around 4,000 beds in November.21.     We will expand our ICU capacity further, in preparation for a potential rise in severe cases. We are currently working with our hospitals to ramp up from 219 to 280 ICU beds for COVID-19 patients. These can be ready this week. If needed, our next expansion will be to 350 beds. We have been repurposing existing hospital wards, such as single rooms and isolation rooms, into additional ICU beds. We have been augmenting ICU manpower by deploying previously trained ICU staff to help with patient care. Non-ICU staff have also been brought in as I described earlier, and they work under the supervision of ICU trained staff. The shift pattern of nurses may have to be adjusted in order to cater to these needs, and this has already started to happen in some hospitals. At the same time, we are also asking the private hospitals to set aside ICU beds to assist in managing both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients who are critically ill.22.     Increasing ICU beds takes time, and it affects regular hospital operations. Converting non-COVID-19 ICU beds for use by COVID-19 patients who need intensive care has a limit, as it diverts resources from non-COVID-19 patients who also need care.23.     The most important limit is the manpower required to staff ICU beds. Patients in ICU need trained staff, who must be able to provide individualised care, including round-the-clock monitoring and continuous care. So, any increase in ICU bed capacity must be supported by an increase in manpower, which has to be diverted from non-COVID ICU duties. Any redeployed staff or new hires also have to undergo training to operate specialised equipment and medical devices in the ICU to care for their COVID-19 patients.24.     Logistically, we can keep stepping up our ICU beds. We have ventilators, equipment, consumables, all the things that are needed. But not enough people. As a result, if we keep increasing beds, we stretch and stretch our healthcare workers. We will come to the point that they will no longer be able to provide that continuous excellent care. Our nurse-to-patient ratio will also be lower, which means each nurse will have to take care of more patients than they do today. In a normal ICU, peacetime, pre-COVID, one nurse looks after 1 or 2 patients. If she has to look after 4, she will not have enough hands or time, to provide the same level of care.25.     There will come a point where even as the Healthcare professionals are doing their best, trying their hardest, more patients will die.26.     And this will affect both COVID and non-COVID patients. As more healthcare resources are diverted to support COVID-19 services, our hospitals’ ability to sustain regular non-COVID-19 services will be reduced.27.     So while we may have plans to step up to certain number of ICU beds, the real situation on the ground, the operational considerations, are not straight forward. We do not want to go anywhere near the theoretically possible number. If we do, the situation can easily get out of hand. It will affect the unvaccinated disproportionately, but it will also affect all the rest of us.28.     MOH has strategies to restrict the number of cases, not only to try to shield our healthcare workers and hospitals from large surges, but also to protect all of us. We will continue to need care for heart disease, diabetes, cancer. We will have accidents and broken bones, and all of these patients, all of us, will need care, comfort and healing.29.     Our ICU staff have been stretched to their limit in the last two weeks. At its peak, we had 171 COVID-19 cases in the ICU, but the situation has eased a little. Today this has come down to 130. The booster doses have helped in reducing severe illnesses among vaccinated seniors, but the unvaccinated continue to be at risk. This is why we continue to monitor the situation very closely, especially the number of unvaccinated seniors who get infected. Every day, there are about 60 of them, and 6 are likely to end up in the ICU. We need to keep this group as small as possible, to ensure everyone who needs care can receive it.COVID-19 Deaths and Severe Cases30.     Thankfully, because of our high vaccination coverage, almost all cases, about 99%, have had no or mild symptoms. We have also managed to keep our fatalities very low. But sadly, we have seen 407 deaths so far. Each death is a tragedy, and a loss felt by the family, the patient’s loved ones, and the care team. Of these, 395 of them passed away in a hospital, 8 at home and 4 at a care facility. The number of deaths has increased in the past two months as the overall number of cases increased.31.     Seniors who are unvaccinated and have underlying medical conditions are at much greater risk of severe illness and death. Close to 95% of those who died in the last six months were seniors aged 60 and above. 72% of all deceased cases had not been fully vaccinated. Almost all of the remaining 28% who were fully vaccinated, suffered from underlying medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer, and heart, lung or kidney diseases. Underlying conditions add risks, even if the conditions are well controlled before the patient encounters COVID19, especially if the patient is elderly.32.     There is not yet conclusive information about the long-term health consequences of COVID-19. An NCID study found that one in ten COVID-19 patients who recovered after the initial infection continued to display symptoms such as coughing or breathlessness 6 months after recovering from the acute illness. A study conducted in the UK found that those who are vaccinated are half as likely to continue having symptoms about a month after COVID-19 infection as compared to those who are unvaccinated.33.     While most of our cases recover fully from COVID-19, we do see instances of re-infection. Up to mid-August, we had detected 32 re-infected cases, and all of them were unvaccinated.34.     The risks of being unvaccinated are high. Compared to the vaccinated, someone who is 60 years old and above and unvaccinated, is 6 times more likely to need oxygen, 8 times more likely to become critically ill and need the ICU, and 17 times more likely to die.35.     So far, we have had one of the lowest fatality rates in the world. At the beginning it was because we had such tight restrictions, rapid contact tracing, and a low total number of cases in the community, but with cases rising fast, the case fatality rate remains low now because we have reached such a high vaccination rate, and because all those who have become sick have been able to receive the care that they need. Our healthcare system is stressed, but it has not been overwhelmed, unlike many countries last year, where patients had to be turned away and doctors had to choose amongst many patients whom to save.36.     These other countries experienced what is known as excess mortality, as the pandemic spread rapidly through the population and hospitals were overwhelmed. Excess mortality is when a lot more people die in a year than you expect.37.     We are trying very hard to avoid that. By keeping restrictions tight last year when our population was vulnerable to the disease, and then cautiously opening up after we vaccinated the vast majority of our population. Even then, we have to accept there will be some deaths. Our goal is to make sure that there are no significant excess deaths, as a result of an inability to provide adequate medical care. So far that is something that we have been able to do, and that we want to keep doing.38.     Up until recently we kept the absolute number of deaths small by ensuring both that few people caught COVID-19 and also that those who were infected got good treatment and care. Now that we have to live with COVID-19, we will continue to protect people from getting infected through vaccination and Safe Management Measures, but this protection is not complete. And that is why much larger numbers will get infected. But we will continue to make sure that those who are infected get good treatment and care, and so keep the death rate from COVID-19 as low as possible. Hence we are doing everything we can to expand our ICU capacity and protect the healthcare system.39.     These efforts have succeeded – our death rate is 0.2%, compared to 3% or more in countries that experienced a surge in cases before vaccination. This rate of 0.2% is comparable to catching pneumonia, pre-COVID. But it does mean that over time the absolute number of deaths from COVID-19 will rise despite the best possible medical care, and we could perhaps have 2,000 deaths per year from COVID-19. Most of these will be the elderly and those who are already unwell.40.     In comparison every year, in peacetime, pre-covid, about 4,000 patients pass on as a result of influenza, viral pneumonias, and other respiratory diseases. These are also mostly the elderly and the unwell. That is why we keep emphasising the importance of vaccination and boosters. We must make sure that everyone who is infected with COVID-19 will receive proper medical care by our healthcare workers and hospital system, and be given the best chance to fight the disease.Conclusion41.     We have got to this point in our fight against COVID19 without excess mortality. We have managed to continue to provide excellent healthcare for all COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. I am extremely proud of my colleagues, co-workers and friends who man the wards, clinics, and many other sites where they perform their duties. And we should place a high value on maintaining this standard.42.     What we are trying to do has not yet been done by any other country. We are trying to get to the point where the combination of high vaccination rates, booster jabs and even more boosting from mild infections means that COVID 19 will no longer spread as an epidemic in Singapore. And we are trying to get there without excess mortality – in other words, though we will have fatalities as a result of COVID-19, we will not see more overall deaths that we would in a normal non-COVID year. Nearly every other country that has arrived at that destination has paid a high price, in lives.43.     I hope my explanation has helped members understand why although we say we are living with COVID-19, we cannot just open up, and risk having the number of cases shoot up. Because more and more cases will translate into more and more ICU beds used, and beyond a certain point that will force us to accept a lower standard of care, and hence have more deaths that could have been prevented. Despite our best efforts events may overtake us, and we may have no choice in the matter. If despite our caution, ICU cases rise sharply, we will still do our very best to look after every patient. But at what level of care? I would strongly prefer if we can avoid that dreadful scenario. We need to continue to manage the overall number of cases in our population, even as we continue to increase our hospital capacity.44.     In all of this there is hope. The main reason why we got to this point in the fight with COVID-19 with such low mortality rates is our people. Across all sectors, everyone has given their all, together with an ongoing commitment to excellence in service.45.     MOH and the Healthcare teams will continue to train staff, increase beds and expand ICU capacity. My MOH colleagues and I will keep working directly with the ICU directors and clinical leads to help them. They know better than me how to manage their patients, to provide clinical care, but they need support, resources, and policies that allow them to optimise outcomes. We will help to look after them, and their staff.46.     All of us can continue to play our part. Vaccination remains critical, every single extra person who gets vaccinated makes a difference, to themselves and for all of us. Getting your booster shot as soon as you are eligible makes a difference. Following the Safe Management Measures makes a difference. Regular testing makes a difference. Using the right healthcare resources appropriately makes a difference.47.     The current situation will not last forever. We will eventually come out of this. Eventually enough of us will be vaccinated or will have been infected, that we will see the case numbers come down and the situation stabilise. But in getting there we should try to keep the number of deaths as low as possible.48.     That we got to this point, where after nearly two years of fighting a pandemic I can explain our hope to maintain one of the lowest case fatality rates in the world is a small miracle. It did not happen by chance. It happened because Singaporeans stood together, looked out for each other, did their duty, and put the interests of others ahead of their own. And the healthcare workers of Singapore have done all this and much much more, caring for us all.49.     I received another message from a colleague: “We are one of the few countries in the world where ICU teams don’t have to worry about resources and equipment – very grateful for that. Healthcare workers have given everything in the last two years, we have held ourselves up to the highest standards, we have the lowest mortality in the world. Our people are still pushing on.”50.     The healthcare workers we are worried about, are also the same healthcare workers who are committed to doing what is needed to look after all their patients. They will do their duty, do their best and try their hardest. Words will never be enough, but I express our gratitude on behalf of this House.

Doctors undergoing training to be specialists also need to comply with guidelines for working hours and training. Efforts are made to ensure that the public healthcare institutions and doctors adhere to these guidelines. Based on an annual survey of residents, 84% complied with work hours of maximum 80 hours a week, 90% have at least a 10-hour interval between duty periods and after in-house calls.Of special mention is the traditional night-call system for junior doctors.  This is a 24-hour duty, which is a longstanding practice that all doctors have gone through to ensure a seamless continuity of care for the patients. To support the well-being of doctors, guidelines on the frequency and duration of night-calls have been introduced. For example, for Post Graduate Year 1 doctors, after a 24 hour duty, they should spend no more than 6 additional hours for handing over and other activities.   Surveys showed that 85% complied with this requirement. Number of calls are mostly within SMC guidelines of 4 to 7 per month. Some of the departments have also introduced night float systems.  Unlike the traditional night-call system, doctors on night float perform approximately 12 hours of on-site duty during evening or night shifts usually for 1 or 2 weeks at a stretch with no other duties in the day. MOH is studying if the float system could complement the traditional call system.   The profession and medical fraternity have traditionally undertaken the responsibility to take care of their juniors.  In response to feedback from junior doctors about working hours and well-being, the Director of Medical Services in MOH had commissioned a national committee, chaired by a very senior doctor, to lead initiatives to promote and improve the well-being of junior doctors in the public healthcare system and look into factors associated with work-related stress among junior doctors such as work hours, duration of night-calls and work structure.  This is in addition to the various initiatives already in place in the healthcare institutions to look after the well-being of junior doctors.     MOH and the public healthcare institutions will continue to better support junior doctors and improve their well-being, while balancing against the demands of the profession and the duty towards patients.   ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/average-weekly-working-hours-of-medical-housemen-in-past-five-years-and-measures-to-reduce-these-hours-in-post-covid-19-environment,

Once registered, an SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to the mobile number, and individuals may use the link to make an appointment at the vaccination centre at Raffles City Convention Centre (RCCC) or at any of the Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) offering the Sinovac vaccine. Individuals who had previously taken at least one dose of the Sinovac vaccine at a private clinic can continue to take the remaining dose(s) of their three-dose regime at any of the clinics listed (without an asterisk) on www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations. They can contact these clinics directly to book their remaining appointments.  For persons who are medically ineligible for a two-dose mRNA vaccine regime and previously invited to receive the Sinovac vaccine under a special public health programme, they should follow the instructions provided in their SMS invitation to continue with their regime. Seniors aged 60 years and above who belong to any of the above groups may also walk into the vaccination centre at RCCC to receive their Sinovac doses. While the Sinovac vaccine is now under the national vaccination programme, we continue to recommend the Pandemic Special Access Route-authorised mRNA vaccines for all persons who are eligible, given the higher vaccine effectiveness against the infection and severe disease, including against the Delta variant.  We hope Mr Go was able to get his vaccinations and we wish him the best of health. Mr Dinesh Vasu DashGroup Director, Crisis Strategy and Operations GroupMinistry of Health",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/appointments-for-sinovac-vaccine-now-available-at-a-vaccination-centre-and-selected-clinics,

The Government takes a serious view of the deliberate communication of these falsehoods and will not hesitate to take action against those who put the public’s health and well-being at risk by spreading misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines.3.   MOH therefore notes and welcomes the latest removal of content from the YouTube channel by Iris Koh, which includes “Town Hall Meeting: United We Stand For Choice”, and “Healing the Divide: Remembering Those We Love and Lost”, for violating YouTube’s Community Guidelines. We also observe that Facebook has previously suspended Iris Koh’s account in more than one instance, for violating their Community Guidelines. 4.   We advise members of the public not to speculate and/or spread misinformation which may cause public alarm, and to refer to credible sources of information instead.5.   Please visit www.moh.gov.sg for the latest information on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccinations.

Over the past fortnight, with everyone’s cooperation and the enhancement of collective immunity of our population, the growth in new COVID-19 cases has moderated. The week-on-week ratio of community cases has decreased and is now hovering around 0.8 to 1.0. While the total number of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and the intensive care unit (ICU) remains high, numbers are also stable. 2.   Progress in vaccination and boosters has contributed immensely to the tempering of COVID-19 cases. However, those who are not fully vaccinated continue to disproportionately make up the bulk of severe and ICU cases, and impose a strain on our healthcare system. There remains a need to protect them. Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) will therefore remain a crucial prong of our re-opening strategy in the coming weeks.3.   With this backdrop, we will carefully ease some measures, while we continue to protect the most vulnerable in our society from the risk of COVID-19 infection.  4.   First, we will allow up to five fully vaccinated persons from the same household to dine-in together at food and beverage (F&B) establishments that are able to administer comprehensive VDS checks. 5.   Second, we will pilot the resumption of more activities for those who are fully vaccinated, starting with sports and selected MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions) events, subject to the additional requirement of testing using Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kits, i.e.  a “VDS+ART” protocol. This will allow higher-risk activities to resume safely. If successful, this protocol can be extended to other settings.  6.   Third, we will take steps towards resuming more activities in schools, in preparation for the larger-scale safe resumption of co-curricular learning activities in the coming school year, as these are critical for the nurturing of well-rounded students. The Ministry of Education (MOE) will provide more details on this separately.7.   Finally, our experience to date with the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) has shown that we can open up air travel in a safe way. We will further simplify travel protocols to safely and seamlessly reconnect with the rest of the world.8.   Notwithstanding these adjustments, there remains a need to stay vigilant in our approach towards COVID-19. ICU utilisation has been hovering at around 70%. While this is still manageable by stretching our healthcare manpower, we must not let down our guard and must avoid a resurgence of cases that could once again threaten to overwhelm our healthcare system.Updates on Local COVID-19 Situation and Healthcare Capacity9.   Daily case numbers have stabilised for around three weeks now. While cases have remained at more than 3,000 a day on average, close to 99% of cases continue to have mild or no symptoms and the vast majority are able to recover well at home. The proportion of patients who require oxygen supplementation has held steady at 0.8% of our total cases, and those who require ICU care at 0.3%, in the past 28 days. The number of cases in the ICU remains high but stable at around 140 cases, who occupy 70% of our current ICU bed capacity. We have been actively expanding the capacity of COVID-19 Treatment Facilities (CTFs) and Community Isolation Facilities (CIFs) over the past few weeks to take in COVID-19 patients who do not require acute care in hospitals. Further Expansion of the Home Recovery Programme10.    We will expand the Home Recovery Programme (HRP) by lowering the minimum age for default home recovery, from 5 years to 3 years old starting from 10 November 2021. All children 3 years and older will be allowed to stay at home if their household environment is suitable. They will undergo a telemedicine assessment by a community or hospital paediatrician. Infants and children from 3 months old to under 3 years of age will also be allowed to recover at home, after they have been clinically assessed at hospitals to be suitable for home recovery. All infants under 3 months of age who are infected with COVID-19 will continue to be admitted to hospital. Good Progress in Vaccinations and Boosters11.   Vaccinations and boosters continue to prove pivotal in safeguarding lives and our healthcare capacity amidst high case volumes, as they provide strong protection against infection and severe illness. To date, 85% of our population have completed their full primary series regimen/ received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines, and 18% have received boosters. We have been prioritising our outreach to encourage seniors to get vaccinated, as they are most vulnerable to serious illness if infected with COVID-19. Currently, 94% of seniors in the 60 to 69 age group and 90% of seniors aged 70 years and above have completed their full primary series regimen of COVID-19 vaccination, while 82% of eligible seniors aged 60 years and above have received boosters. We are heartened by the growing number of persons coming forward for their vaccinations and boosters, and strongly encourage everyone to do so as soon as they are eligible. This will help to keep you and your loved ones safe. Expanding Vaccination Eligibility to Protect Our Children12.   The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) has noted that the Pfizer BioNTech/ Comirnaty vaccine has been approved by the US for use in those aged 5 to 11 years. EC19V is assessing the extension of vaccination to children aged 5 to 11 years in Singapore. This will confer on them protection against infection and severe illness, and better enable the resumption of a richer educational experience for our school children in 2022. Further Bolstering Our Healthcare Capacity 13.   Given the good progress in vaccinations and boosters, our National Vaccination Programme (NVP) has shifted to focusing on booster jabs. As vaccination capacity remains robust overall, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will be closing four more Vaccination Centres (VCs) on 1 December 2021. The healthcare staff currently working in these VCs can then be re-deployed to bolster our manpower needs in other areas, such as the COVID-19 Treatment Facilities. 14.   These four VCs are Kebun Baru Community Club (CC), Potong Pasir CC, Taman Jurong CC and Geylang Serai CC. The last day for Dose One walk-ins at Kebun Baru CC and Potong Pasir CC was on 6 November 2021, while the last day for Dose One walk-ins at Taman Jurong CC and Geylang Serai CC will be on 9 November 2021. All four will continue to accept appointments for Dose Two and booster vaccinations until 30 November 2021. COVID-19 Patients who are Unvaccinated by Choice to be Responsible for their Medical Bills15.   The Government is currently footing the full COVID-19 medical bills of all Singaporeans, Permanent Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders (SCs/PRs/LTPHs), other than for those who tested positive soon after returning from overseas travel. This was to avoid financial considerations adding to public uncertainty and concern when COVID-19 was an emergent and unfamiliar disease. For the majority who are vaccinated, this special approach for COVID-19 bills will continue until the COVID-19 situation is more stable.16.   Currently, unvaccinated persons make up a sizeable majority of those who require intensive inpatient care, and disproportionately contribute to the strain on our healthcare resources.17.   Hence, from 8 December 2021, we will begin charging COVID-19 patients who are unvaccinated by choice.[1] This will apply to all unvaccinated COVID-19 patients admitted on or after 8 December 2021 to hospitals and CTFs. COVID-19 medical bills for those who are ineligible for vaccination will still be fully paid for by the government, i.e. children under 12 years old or medically ineligible persons.18.   COVID-19 patients who are unvaccinated by choice may still tap on regular healthcare financing arrangements to pay for their bills where applicable – SCs and PRs may access regular Government subsidies and MediShield Life/ Integrated Shield Plan (MSHL/ IP) where applicable, while LTPHs may tap on their usual financing arrangements, such as private insurance.Calibrated Adjustments of Safe Management Measures (SMMs)Easing of Dine-In Restrictions for Households19.   From 10 November 2021, up to 5 fully vaccinated persons from the same household[2] will be allowed to dine in together at F&B establishments. Nevertheless, we urge households to continue to exercise care and restraint when dining out together, especially if there are elderly members staying in the household. The dine-in group size for those who qualify for VDS but are not from the same household will remain capped at 2.20.   For now, this easing will not be extended to hawker centres and coffee shops as they are unable to conduct comprehensive VDS checks of all their diners. We are prepared to extend the same concession to hawker centres and coffee shops once they have put in place additional control measures. The National Environment Agency (NEA) and Singapore Food Agency (SFA) will be engaging the hawkers’ associations and coffee shop operators respectively on this matter. Further updates will be provided when ready.  21.   Strict enforcement actions will be taken against any individuals who breach this rule by pretending to be from the same household as well as F&B outlets that do not implement the necessary checks. Errant individuals will be fined, and F&B outlets will be subject to immediate closures. These penalties will apply even for first-time offenders.  Music for F&B Establishments and Zone Sizes22.   We will also make several adjustments to existing SMMs from 10 November 2021, in order to better facilitate operations for businesses and workplaces. F&B establishments will be allowed to play soft recorded music from 10 November 2021, but live music and entertainment remain disallowed. Other measures include an increase in zone sizes for various event categories such as congregational worship and live performances, whilst keeping within overall attendance numbers. Details can be found in Annex A.Expanding VDS to More Settings, and “VDS+ART” pilots 23.   To better protect the unvaccinated who are at higher risk of infection and severe illness, we intend to expand VDS to more settings over time. As a start, MOH will also introduce VDS for residential care homes, given that this is a vulnerable setting where unvaccinated residents are likely to suffer worse outcomes than their vaccinated counterparts if they contract COVID-19. Measures will apply to areas like visitations and activities for residents. MOH will share more details when ready.24.   In addition, we will explore further easing of SMMs for settings which are able to enforce both VDS and pre-activity testing (“VDS+ART”). Under this regime, all participants will need to be fully vaccinated and will be required to produce a valid negative ART result on-site prior to the activity. We will begin with pilots in sports settings, to allow the resumption of team sports for a group of up to 10 fully vaccinated persons (including players, umpires, linesmen, etc.) to play together in controlled and supervised settings at suitable ActiveSG sports centres and PA community clubs from 10 November 2021. Please refer to SportSG’s advisory for more details. 25.   We will also pilot the use of “VDS+ART” at selected mass sporting events as well as selected MICE events, where we will allow some easing of the SMMs.  If successful, we can expand such pilots to additional settings.  VDS Concession for Medically Ineligible Individuals 26.   We are taking a stronger stance against those who choose not to be vaccinated, be it through the VDS, or by requiring them to pay for their medical bills. But we recognise that there are a few individuals who are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme (NVP). As earlier announced by the MTF, these individuals will be exempted from the VDS. 27.   This VDS concession for medically ineligible individuals will take effect from 1 December 2021. From 15 November 2021, such individuals can visit any General Practitioner (GP) clinic, or public or private healthcare institution to be certified as medically ineligible, subject to meeting the revised criteria articulated in Annex B. They will be issued with a standard paper memo, which should be presented along with a government-issued photo identification card to be exempted from VDS. Please refer to Annex C for a list of settings with VDS.28.   MOH is also working with GovTech to reflect the medical ineligibility status in individuals’ TraceTogether App, so that they are able to pass through TraceTogether/ Safe Entry check-in systems at VDS venues without needing to show the paper memo. MOH will separately update healthcare establishments on the certification process.  29.   While we have extended a concession to those who are medically ineligible to be able to dine-in, enter malls and participate in activities where VDS is required, they remain unvaccinated and their risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 and/or becoming severely ill remains real and very high. We strongly encourage these individuals to minimise such activities and to use this concession judiciously.Ongoing Updates to Border Measures Review of Countries/ Regions Categories30.   As part of our regular review of the COVID-19 situation in countries/ regions, we have updated the list of countries/ regions in the various categories. Details are in Annex D. These will be effective for arrivals from 11 November 2021, 2359 hours. Changes in Border Measures for Cat II/III Countries31.   We will be expanding the types of tests recognised as a valid Pre-Departure Test (PDT) for all travellers arriving in, or transiting through, Singapore from Category II/III countries/ regions (including travellers arriving via VTL). This is in alignment with the testing protocols we now have in place in Singapore. From 11 November 2021, 2359 hours, we will also accept a negative, professionally administered[3] ART result taken within 2 days[4] prior to departure as a valid PDT for travellers from these countries/ regions.Extending Vaccinated Travel Lanes32.   We have launched VTLs with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States, and will be launching a joint VTL with the Republic of Korea (ROK) from 15 November 2021. Travellers under the VTLs need not be subject to Stay-Home Notice (SHN). Instead, they will be required to produce a negative PDT taken within two days prior to departure and undergo an on-arrival Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test.  33.   We will launch a joint VTL with Malaysia for travel between Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) from 29 November 2021. Vaccinated Travel Pass applications for Short-Term Visitors and Long-Term Pass Holders will commence on 22 November 2021; returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who are fully vaccinated will not need to apply. Singapore and Malaysia are also in detailed discussion to launch a similar scheme for travel across the land links. 34.   We will also extend the VTLs to Finland and Sweden from 29 November 2021, with applications for Short-Term Visitors and Long-Term Pass Holders commencing on 22 November 2021. 35.   The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will provide more details nearer the date when applications are open.Towards a COVID-19 Resilient Singapore36.   We thank everyone for your understanding and patience during the Stabilisation Phase. We will continue to adjust our measures progressively to prepare for a safe re-opening without compromising the well-being of the vulnerable members of our community. We seek everyone’s continued effort and cooperation to exercise social responsibility and comply with all the SMMs and VDS measures we have put in place. If you are eligible for vaccinations or boosters, do come forward to receive them. Test yourself regularly and follow the simplified health protocols if you test positive. This will ensure that our limited healthcare resources are effectively allocated to those in need, and pave the way to being a COVID-19 resilient nation. MINISTRY OF HEALTH 8 NOVEMBER 2021[1] We will not charge individuals who are partially vaccinated until 31 December 2021, to allow them time to be fully vaccinated.  From 1 January 2022, only SC/PR/LTPH COVID-19 patients who are fully vaccinated and have not recently travelled will have their COVID-19 medical bills fully paid for by the Government.[2] Including unvaccinated children 12 years old and below, in line with their eligibility for VDS.[3] ART has to be performed by trained professionals (e.g. medical professionals, Government-recognised trained professionals, etc.)[4] For example, if the PDT is taken on 1 November 2021, it will be valid for departures (for air/ sea checkpoints) or arrivals (for land checkpoint) up to 3 November 2021, 2359 hours.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/calibrated-adjustments-in-stabilisation-phase_8Nov2021,

I am very pleased to join everyone, so early in the morning to witness the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between SingHealth and SGInnovate. We are able to have this event online amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, due to technology. But actually, the rules do allow us to meet physically without food and with our masks on, the problem is we don’t get to see each other’s faces. So it is always a trade-off now. But no doubt, the world has changed drastically in the last 20 years. We have information and vast computing power literally in our hands. And Artificial Intelligence (AI) tells us where to go, what to buy and what to watch. We are witnessing the start of a revolution in healthcare too, starting with smart devices tracking our vital signs, our activities and recommending customised workout plans, habits, that benefit us in the best possible way.AI is Already a Part of our Lives2. Three inter-connected factors made all these possible. 3. First, the exponential rise in the availability of data – the majority coming from the Internet. And these are mostly user-generated raw data from social media and the “Internet of Things”, which are captured by computers to learn the underlying trends and patterns from a wide range of cases and examples. It is as if the computer had walked the many journeys undertaken by many people, and extracted their habits, their lifestyle, their wisdom in a focused topic.4. Second, is machine learning, in particular deep learning, which by processing that vast amount of data, mimic the human’s ability to sense, comprehend and learn continuously. It is like the craftsmen of old, who hone their skills over a lifetime, except the machine does so in a compressed time when fed with a treasure trove of data.5. Third, the ever-faster processing speed and ever-growing on-board memory capacity of computers, which continues to validate Moore’s Law.6. The result is AI that is changing the world as we know it. The seminal breakthroughs in AI technology were reported in rather understated way, in its ability to outplay humans in certain games.7. For example, in 1997, Deep Blue beat a reigning world chess champion under tournament conditions. But Deep Blue essentially memorised all possible moves and countermoves and demonstrated how much and how fast computers can store and process information. That was what the victory meant.  8. And that computer ability was further demonstrated in 2011, when Watson beat two of the greatest human champions of the Jeopardy game show. The knowledge of computer demonstrated then had gone beyond chess moves, to all facets of human knowledge. 9. And then in 2016, AlphaGo defeated the top human players of the game of Go, a far more sophisticated game of strategy with, I believe, infinite moves. This is AI and machine now learning in action, not just memorising and storing moves.10. To beat humans in our own games are bell-weather events that herald the possibility of AI. It is a signal to humankind, that AI can potentially transform life as we know it. We are now faced with the choice of riding the AI wave to improve lives and augment our relevance, or be made redundant by it.11. So today, let me speak about the relevance of AI in just one sector, which is healthcare.AI in Healthcare12. Healthcare is a beneficiary of AI. Computer scientists have successfully cracked a decades-old protein-folding challenge with an AI system that could eventually help identify new treatments for diseases.13. Locally, scientists used the capability of AI in understanding natural language, as shown in the Jeopardy game, to develop chatbots. A useful chatbot is Doctor COVID, which can speak to the migrant workers infected with COVID-19 in their languages, and enables our healthcare teams to better monitor their clinical and mental wellness at community care facilities. And this was mentioned by Professor Ivy Ng just now.14. Changi General Hospital and the Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) also co-developed a deep-learning system to estimate the likelihood that a patient may develop severe pneumonia based on an automated assessment of chest X-rays and this allows early intervention from doctors.15. A joint research team from the Singapore National Eye Centre, Singapore Eye Research Institute and NUS School of Computing, they developed what is called SELENA+, which stands for Singapore Eye LEsioN Analyser Plus. It is an AI system which uses retina images to detect major eye diseases. It has been deployed to 20 polyclinics. SELENA+ will help us overcome our shortage of trained healthcare professionals who can detect high-risk patients early and then prevent future blindness.16. Now, using wearable sensors and cloud computing, patients’ real-time vital sign readings and symptoms can be remotely monitored. The data is then analysed using AI to predict early complications of diseases.17. So beyond all these examples of current applications of AI in healthcare, there are also immense opportunities to leverage AI to improve care, to advance medical science, and ultimately save more lives.18. Let me briefly mention three promising initiatives, not necessarily technological in nature, to boost the development of healthcare in Singapore, and unleash the potential of it.Initiatives to boost the development of Health AI 19. First, building up our healthcare database, as the foundation to drive AI innovation. And this is a key reason for developing the National Electronic Health Record (NEHR) in 2011. NEHR brought together clinical summary records from different care providers, mostly from public healthcare institutions, but increasingly also private providers.20. Beyond clinical records, we are generating genomic information of 100,000 consenting individuals from Singapore. We are accumulating anonymised lifestyle data for research through various national programmes and partnerships with the private sector, such as the National Steps Challenge and LumiHealth (and this is HPB’s collaboration with Apple). These data will tune the AI systems to our population, and our local context, so as to better predict health risks and outcomes, and improve recommendations on interventions that could slow down or reverse disease progression.21. Second initiative, we have put in place regulations and guidelines that encourage and enable the responsible use of AI in healthcare. MOH, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) and IHiS have codified good practices through the AIHGlE (Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Guidelines) project, and this support the safe growth of AI in healthcare. This will enhance trust in AI’s legitimate and broad usage in healthcare.22. Third initiative, we are encouraging multidisciplinary collaborations and innovations in AI projects. The most impactful innovations involve the combination of skills and talents across many domains and disciplines, technical and non-technical. We must therefore tap on the range of capabilities in our Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) ecosystem, in private as well as public sectors.23. One good example is the AI in Health Grand Challenge run by AI Singapore. With funding from the National Research Foundation, AI Singapore has allocated up to S$35 million to support the co-development of AI solutions between public healthcare institutions and institutes of higher learning. The aim is to enhance primary care, health promotion, wellness maintenance, and disease management.Partnership between SingHealth and SGInnovate24. Which brings us to today’s event. The MOU that will be signed today marks a new milestone towards a more integrated and forward-looking partnership between SingHealth and SGInnovate. SGInnovate’s capabilities are to translate scientific research into ‘technology intensive’ applications. SingHealth, on the other hand, is home to our oldest healthcare institution, the Singapore General Hospital, celebrating its bicentenary this year, and one of the most renowned in the world for delivering excellent care to its patients.25. So together, they can advance health AI innovations in meaningful ways, building upon the national foundations we have set and will continue to build, that I mentioned earlier.26. SingHealth and SGInnovate will organise knowledge sharing events, and build up Communities of Practice, to bring together deep expertise in healthcare and AI, including the Deep Tech community of corporates, start-ups and innovators.27. This partnership will also focus on providing start-ups with the resources they need to develop and grow. This includes connecting innovators to potential investors, and supporting start-ups in developing business plans, go-to-market strategies, and commercial networking.28. SGInnovate will also encourage Deep Tech entrepreneurs to work alongside clinician scientists, clinician investigators, doctors, nurses, and allied health professionals from SingHealth. The collaboration can be done through the form of Reverse Pitches, where innovators from SingHealth present clinical needs to a network of start-ups to come up with solutions.29. Finally, the partnership will develop talent through real-world training opportunities and exchanges. This includes tapping on venture capitalists and multinational companies, to provide on-the-job training opportunities to help more local talent develop innovation and enterprise capabilities.Closing30. This partnership will combine the unique strengths of SingHealth and SGInnovate, to harness the vast potential in technology and innovation. And indeed, we are at the cusp of a revolution in healthcare technology.31. But I like to end my speech today with one reminder, one which all the clinicians amongst us instinctively know. Although I am not one, I know that you will feel so instinctively. Which is, despite the numerous intelligences that technology can mimic, it can never replicate the love, care and empathy of a good doctor.32. When AlphaGo defeated the world champion in Go, the champion felt despair. AlphaGo felt neither happiness from winning and no desire to cheer. AlphaGo doesn’t love nor hate the game.33. Healthcare is an industry with high compassion and empathy. In our quest to raise capability and deliver better care, let's make sure AI works alongside us, not as artificial intelligence, but as augmented intelligence that empowers our healthcare workers to have a greater capacity to bring more love, care and compassion to our patients.34. I wish SingHealth and SGInnovate much success in this important endeavour.Thank you.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-advancing-health-science-innovations-singhealth-sginnovate-memorandum-of-understanding-signing-ceremony,

Pre-conceptions are being dispelled.  The pandemic demonstrated that prevention, management and treatment are an integrated continuum to keep individuals and society from the harm of diseases.  Societal resilience protects the individual patient, while each individual patient’s personal action collectively builds up population and public health resilience. 6.     The pandemic is a major inflexion point for those practising public health and occupational medicine, in terms of raising the profile and importance of your work.  7.     There is no doubt that at the height of a transmission wave when hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) admissions go up, and the medical personnel in hospitals are under the most stress.  We depend on them to hold the fort and minimise casualties due to the pandemic.  8.     At the same time, it highlights the importance of upstream work in minimising the number of patients needing hospital care.  In that regard, the experience of countries like Singapore, and now Australia and New Zealand, is rather unique.9.     At the start of the crisis, our systemic responses were based on the experience with SARS.  Like many countries in Asia, we relied on important public health measures, namely, contact tracing and quarantine to curtail the transmission of the virus.  10.     In other countries, especially in the Americas and Europe, they relied on an Influenza-based response – protecting the vulnerable especially the seniors, self-isolation and masking.  But COVID-19 was a more infectious and vicious virus than Influenza.  Hospitals in those countries were overwhelmed, and death rates were high.  Our SARS-like response to COVID-19 helped us avert a major human tragedy. 11.     With vaccination, the case mortality rate of COVID-19 has been brought down drastically. From Singapore’s own experience, the case mortality rate of COVID-19 was about half that of Influenza for those who received a full regimen of COVID-19 vaccination.  After having the large majority of our population vaccinated, and with the advice of public health professionals, the Government declared a new strategy of transiting to living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease.  12.     We had to flip our playbook, from SARS-like to more Influenza-like. The turning point was around National Day this year.      13.     We knew this would be a difficult transition period.  We are not familiar with an Influenza-like public health response.  We fortified our hospitals as much as we can, continue to administer vaccines to the remaining population yet to receive their jabs, maintain key aspects of safe management measures such as masking and limiting group sizes. But progressively and very cautiously, we opened up our borders, allowing events and weddings to continue.  14.     There are two big changes in our public health response.  First, we had to develop a Home Recovery Programme, which caters to about 70% of patients today.  It was a difficult start because we needed to ramp it up very quickly, but with the hard work of the team from the SAF, we have stabilised the operations. 15.     Second, we reset our healthcare protocols, from a convoluted web of rules and regulations designed to snuff out the virus, to one that is simple and intuitive to understand so as to limit transmission by relying on individual responsibility.  16.     Importantly, we removed quarantine as a public health response.  The day after the new rules came into effect, I took a walk around my constituency, and could sense a palpable sense of relief.  The uncertainty and fear of being confined and unable to work, unable to bring home an income, unable to look after aged parents and kids, were lifted off the minds of parents and workers.  17.     To make home recovery work, and remove the burden of fear of quarantine, these were critical steps in changing the psychology of society in the face of a public health crisis. We moved towards a virus that has become less deadly than Influenza, for the vaccinated.  18.     At every step of the way, we guided our decisions on research, data, analytics and simulation.  When taking care of patients, we relied on integrated care models, coordination across health settings and community engagement.19.     Our fight continues. It is and will be a delicate balance on three fronts - further opening up our economy and society and regaining our pre-COVID-19 freedoms, continuing to vaccinate and boost our population while protecting those who are vulnerable and unvaccinated, and preserving our healthcare capacity so that when all preventive steps fail, we can still save as many lives as we can at the hospitals. 20.     With each passing day, our collective resilience builds up, giving us scope to relax restrictions further, offering reprieve to our hospitals with less crowded wards. We will eventually arrive at our destination of living with COVID-19 as an endemic disease.  But it is a very difficult and even painful process of adaptation. 21.     Throughout this crisis of a generation, the collaboration between policymakers, healthcare professionals, and other stakeholders across the public and private sectors, was tight and almost seamless.  Everyone relied on the other.  This was public service at its best. 22.     When the pandemic eventually subsides, I think we will develop many new capabilities, and gain valuable perspectives in solving future public health problems.  By then, we will have to deal with a far larger challenge, that of the healthcare demands and needs of an ageing population.  23.     Public health and occupational medicine will have to influence social determinants of health to keep the population healthy, and work with primary care providers to prevent the onset of serious illnesses.  Hospitals will continue to man their posts as the last line of defence, to treat and cure the very sick, in the most effective and affordable way possible. That description is no different from dealing with the pandemic, but we are dealing with a challenge of a generation, one that is ageing rapidly.24.     I wish everyone a successful and fruitful conference.

SGP,Asia,Singapore,14/11/2021,237203,1723,2695.714,586,10,12.714,43494.756,315.938,494.3,"Speech by Mr Ong Ye Kung, Minister for Health, At World Diabetes Day 2021","Dr Kalpana, President of Diabetes SingaporeDistinguished GuestsLadies and Gentlemen1. It is my pleasure to join all of you today to commemorate World Diabetes Day and let me congratulate Diabetes Singapore as you turn 50 this year. And I am thankful for your many years of contribution.2. You have been a key partner for the Ministry of Health (MOH) in our fight against diabetes. Working closely to support our General Practitioners (GPs), Diabetes Singapore is always striving to meet the care needs of patients in the community and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, your centres and mobile van services remained accessible to all patients. And I certainly hope you can organise the activities that you just presented for a good cause.The Harm of Diabetes2. Diabetes is a major public health concern. Globally, nearly half a billion people around the world are living with the disease. Locally, one in three individuals in Singapore is at risk of developing diabetes in their lifetime. If nothing is done, by 2050, it is estimated that about one million Singaporeans will be living with diabetes.3. What are the implications for these individuals? A lifetime of daily medication, injection if you are lucky, if not, blindness, amputation, kidney dialysis and premature deaths. It is debilitating and painful for the patient as well as their families.4. Tackling diabetes therefore has become very critical, especially in the light of COVID-19 pandemic because those with diabetes face an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 complications and having poorer health outcomes. As COVID-19 progressively becomes an endemic disease, diabetes patients are subject to heightened risks.5. That is why we declare a War on Diabetes, and the Prime Minister spoke about it during his 2017 National Day Rally. So, let me give an update on the progress of this war.Progress of War on Diabetes6. This is a long war, and any significant results will show up many years later. Age-standardised diabetes prevalence therefore has remained stable from 2017 to 2019. It has not worsened, it is just stable, but these things really take time. It is about 8%, just under 8%. Nevertheless, since we started this whole-of-nation effort, we are seeing some initial signs of improvements.Healthy Living 7. First, in terms of healthy living, especially exercise and diet. Based on the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Report for Singapore, 26% of the disease burden caused by diabetes is due to dietary risk, and 50% by being overweight.8. Across all ages, more Singaporeans engaged in leisure-time regular exercise, from 29.4% in 2017 to 33.4% in 2020. So every 100 Singaporeans, you will find about four more being more active. The increase in proportion of the adults aged 50 to 74 who exercised regularly was particularly prominent and encouraging, from 23.5% in 2017 to 31.4% in 2020.9.  To get Singaporeans to be more active, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has created additional community spaces for more physical activity sessions, and has resumed on average about 430 weekly physical activity sessions. Season 6 of the National Steps Challenge has also started. I think another major factor is that more people are exploring all our beautiful park connectors, the green corridor, and also our various gardens, and also, walking and cycling trails. And all of these were painstakingly put in and developed by our agencies, such as National Parks Board as well as the Land Transport Authority .10. In terms of diet, there are also positive signs. The Eat Drink Shop Healthy Challenge, with more than 900,000 participants, has shown that the average Healthier Choice Symbol items purchased per participant has grown from 5 items per week in January to 5.7 items per week in October 2021. Two data points doesn’t create a trend but we will continue to monitor this.11. The retail market share of healthier food products sold in supermarkets and retail outlets increased by more than 1.5 times to 27% compared to five years ago. And this include Low GI products which help those at risk and living with diabetes to better manage their blood sugar levels. One in three F&B outlets now offer healthier options for dining out.12. Before the end of next year, and with the support of the industry, and this is a very important development, we will implement mandatory nutrition labels and advertising prohibitions on pre-packaged beverages and this will help reduce sugar and saturated fat intake.13. Since we announced these labelling measures, so we don’t have to wait till end of next year to see these results, because since we announced this initiative, major manufacturers such as Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Yeos, F&N, Pokka, MDI and Nestle, they have reformulated their products to significantly reduce sugar levels. In response, consumers have also shifted to buying healthier versions of the products, or smaller packet sizes.14. In partnership with the Ministry Of Education and Early Childhood Development Agency, HPB has implemented healthy meals programmes in all our mainstream schools and 80% of our pre-schools and this is to inculcate healthy eating habits from young. A key initiative is to help cut down the sugar intake of children. The importance of leading a healthy lifestyle to prevent chronic diseases such as diabetes are also part of our school curriculum today.15. I should sound a word of caution here. While we have made some progress, on the whole, unfortunately, obesity and insufficient physical activity are still problems amongst our population. Across all ages, our obesity prevalence has risen from 8.6% in 2017 to 10.5% in 2020. We have also returned to the previous level seen in 2010, after having decreases over the past decade. Our 2018/2019 National Nutrition Survey showed that Singaporeans consumed on average 12 teaspoons of sugar daily, much more than what is nutritionally required.16. So while we see some signs of change over the last three years since we waged War on Diabetes, it will take time for the changes to percolate throughout the population and show a long-lasting effect. And in the meantime, lack of activity, sugar intake, obesity, continue to be a population-wide problem. But in the meantime, COVID-19 has also affected the way Singaporeans live their lifestyles. For some Singaporeans, deprived of social activities, their lifestyle may have become more sedentary, which will set us back in the War on Diabetes and negate these initial results, so we have to just keep pushing on.Screening17. Let me now talk about screening. We are seeing more people screening for diabetes early. This is important, because early detection means you have the time and the chance, to turn things around, reverse the progression of the disease and prevent the development of complications.18. We have made screening more accessible and affordable through the national Screen for Life programme, which includes screening and the first follow-up visit at CHAS GP clinics.19. From 2017 to 2020, about two-thirds of residents aged 40 to 74 years were screened for diabetes, hypertension and hyperlipidemia within the recommended frequency. What we are heartened to see is a slight improvement in the screening participation for those aged 40 to 49 years from 60.7% in 2017 to 62.5% in 2020.20. For the younger population aged 18 to 39 years, I encourage you to take the Diabetes Risk Assessment on HealthHub to find out if you are at risk of developing diabetes. Those identified to be at higher risk, will also be eligible for the Screen for Life programme and speak to your GP if need be.21. One early indicator of more frequent and regular screening is the percentage of diabetes patients that has been diagnosed for the first time. A higher percentage means that they have been screened early and detected early, with the possibility of reversing course. So that percentage has gone up from 22.7% in 2017 to 23.2% in 2019, very slight, but it is the right direction.Disease Management22. Finally, there has been improvement in disease management. Complication rates from diabetes have declined from 2015 to 2019. For kidney failure, the rate of newly diagnosed cases declined from 4.2 to 3.6 per 1,000 patients with diabetes; severe diabetic retinopathy from 6.2 to 4.5; major lower limb amputations rate from 116 to 66 per 100,000 during the same period, which is a significant reduction.23. To anchor and strengthen chronic disease management in the community, we have established Primary Care Networks (PCNs) to support GP clinics in delivering more holistic team-based care to patients with diabetes and other chronic diseases. And I thank Diabetes Singapore for supporting all our PCNs.24. We will be launching a public campaign under the Patient Empowerment for Self-care Framework at the end of this year. We will encourage patients to take better care of themselves, raise awareness on eye and foot complications, and go for regular complications screening. The campaign will also raise awareness on the National Diabetes Reference Materials hosted on HealthHub.Conclusion25. In conclusion, the theme for this year’s World Diabetes Day is “Access to Diabetes Care”.  Improving access has been a key focus in our strategy for the War on Diabetes across the three strategic thrusts – Healthy Living and Prevention, Early Detection and Intervention, and Better Disease Management – three topics that I have just spoke about.26. The War on Diabetes requires the nation to come together to achieve the desired health outcomes in the long run, so let’s not lose sight of such longer wars as we battle COVID-19 here and now. I wish Diabetes Singapore a successful World Diabetes Day 2021 and I also want to just thank you sincerely, for your support and understanding. It has been almost two years of very difficult times. We have to implement all kinds of rules, which also make operations difficult. Even good causes are difficult to implement sometimes because of the rules. But I think you show a lot of understanding and pushed ahead with whatever you need to do and continue to persevere in this war and in this partnership and in this battle against diabetes. So thank you very much. So let’s continue to work very closely together and make sure we continue to make progress in winning this war. Thank you.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-world-diabetes-day-2021,
SGP,Asia,Singapore,15/11/2021,239272,2069,2638.429,594,8,11.857,43874.138,379.382,483.796,"Extending Vds-enabled Activities, Vaccinated Travel Lanes and Recreation Activities for Migrant Workers As Part of Calibrated Easing In Stabilisation Phase","      On 8 November 2021, the Multi-Ministry Task Force (MTF) announced the calibrated easing of selected safe management measures (SMMs) as part of the mid-point review of the extended Stabilisation Phase. SMMs for migrant workers residing in dormitories will similarly be eased now in a calibrated manner, by expanding their community visit programme and allowing daily visits to the Recreation Centres (RCs) for migrant workers. We are also progressively rolling out more stringent implementation of Vaccination Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) in hawker centres and coffee shops, in consultation with the operators, to allow up to five fully vaccinated individuals from the same household to dine-in together after being checked-in via SafeEntry. Pilots imposing more stringent entry conditions, e.g. Antigen Rapid Tests (ARTs) on top of participants being fully vaccinated, in exchange for more permissive SMMs, will also be rolled out in selected MICE, musical and sporting events in the coming weeks. Finally, we will continue reconnecting Singapore with the rest of the world in a safe way, by extending Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs) to include India, Indonesia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. Updates on Local COVID-19 Situation and Healthcare Capacity 2.     The week-on-week ratio of community cases has remained stable at around 0.8 to 1.0 this past week. We should expect the ratio to drift upwards as more restrictions are being relaxed and there are more social interactions. While daily case numbers continue to trend at around 3,000 a day, close to 99% of cases continue to have mild or no symptoms and the vast majority are recovering well at home. 3.     The proportion of patients who require oxygen supplementation has held steady at 0.8% of our total cases, and those who require intensive care unit (ICU) care at 0.3%, in the past 28 days. The number of cases in the ICU remains high but stable in the past week at close to 130 cases per day. Our overall ICU occupancy is approximately 63%. Updates on VDS Measures for Businesses and Community Pilots with VDS+Test Protocol 4.     We had announced our intention to pilot greater allowances for activities involving those who are less vulnerable and are fully vaccinated, subject to the additional requirement of testing before participation, i.e.  a “VDS+Test” protocol. The test (Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or ART) results must be reflected on TraceTogether, or performed or supervised by the event organiser or venue operator (either in person or virtually).  5.     We will start off with selected MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences and Exhibitions), spectator sports and live performance events, where capacity limits and zoning requirements will be eased in a calibrated manner. The pilots kicked off today with the Milken Institute Asia Summit (15-16 November 2021), and will also apply to the Bloomberg New Economy Forum (16-19 November 2021), and Industrial Transformation Asia Pacific 2021 (22-24 November 2021). JJ Lin’s two-day charity live concert “After the Rain” (27-28 November 2021), and a ONE Championship martial arts event in the coming months will also be included. More details on the requirements and safe management measures will be released by the respective event organisers. 6.     The outcomes of these pilots will be assessed before deciding how to expand the protocol to more events and settings, as part of our broader plan to allow safe resumption of further activities as we move towards being a COVID-19 resilient nation. Dine-in Restrictions for Hawker Centres and Coffee Shops 7.     We had announced earlier that we will tighten the imposition of VDS in hawker centres and coffee shops, as these are mask-off settings where the unvaccinated can get infected easily. It is therefore important to have proper checks on vaccination status before someone enters a hawker centre or coffee shop, and to allow only those who are fully vaccinated to sit down to eat. This can make a very significant difference to our healthcare capacity, and especially ICU occupancy. 8.     However, these are settings where implementation and enforcement are more challenging. The National Environment Agency (NEA) has been engaging the Hawkers’ Associations and Town Councils. We expect the first group of hawker centres to put in place access control and checking systems before the end of November. For these hawker centres, once the systems are up, fully vaccinated individuals from the same household can dine in groups of five, just like other F&B establishments. The remaining hawker centres should then be able to follow soon after.  9.     As for coffeeshops, the Singapore Food Agency (SFA) has similarly been engaging the operators and will provide them with the option of putting in place a system to control access and check the status of their patrons, which will allow them to enjoy the concession for individuals from the same household to dine in groups of five. Otherwise, the prevailing group size of two will apply.  10.     For dine-in of up to five individuals from the same household, we will expand the list of acceptable documents to check for proof of residence, from NRIC and SingPass, to the following approved Government digital apps: myICA and SGWorkPass. Further Expansion of Community Visit Programme and More Convenient Access to Recreation Centres for Migrant Workers Residing in Dormitories 11.     The migrant worker dormitories are now more COVID-resilient, with 98% of migrant workers residing in dormitories fully vaccinated1. Migrant workers are also taking up booster vaccinations at an encouraging pace as they become eligible. COVID-19 infections in the dormitories have stabilised over the last few weeks with an average daily number of 143 migrant workers testing PCR positive in the last week. They also have to undergo weekly testing, regardless of vaccination status2.  12.     Hence, from 3 December 2021, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) will further ease restrictions for migrant workers residing in dormitories by expanding the community visit programme from 3,000 migrant workers per week to 3,000 vaccinated migrant workers per day to visit any location within the community, for up to eight hours per visit. The necessary safeguards such as additional pre-event ART, i.e., before they leave their dormitories, remain in place as an added precaution.    13.     We will also make RC visits more accessible for migrant workers. They will be allowed to visit the RCs daily with an extended duration of eight hours per visit. This is up from the thrice weekly cap on RC vists that is currently in place. Unvaccinated migrant workers are required to undergo a pre-visit ART to be allowed entry into RCs. 14.     From mid-December, we will further increase access to RCs, and allow migrant workers to visit any RCs of their choice. MOM is working with RC operators to increase the variety of activities at the RCs, such as organising screenings of movies and sports games, and putting in place processes to manage a larger number of visits from migrant workers. More details can be found in the Annex A. New Affordable Self-Test ART Kits Approved for Use 15.     The Ministry of Health (MOH) and Health Sciences Authority (HSA), with the assistance of Diagnostic Development Hub (DxD) in Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and our healthcare institutions, have been actively sourcing for more high quality and affordable self-test ART kits, to bring down costs while ensuring that those authorised for sale in Singapore continue to meet stringent safety and quality standards. 16.     To this end, on 8 November 2021, HSA had authorised the Flowflex ART kit under the Pandemic Special Access Route (PSAR) for self-test use, bringing the total number of approved ART kits to nine. Additionally, two other ART kits have been approved to undergo PSAR registration. We expect these kits to be priced significantly below the current prices of ART kits. Ongoing Updates to Border Measures Review of Countries/ Regions Categories 17.     As part of our regular review of the COVID-19 situation in countries/ regions, we have updated the list of countries/ regions in the various categories. Details are in Annex B. These will be effective for arrivals from 18 November 2021, 2359 hours. Extension of Vaccinated Travel Lanes to India, Indonesia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates 18.     To-date, we have launched VTLs with Australia, Brunei, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Republic of Korea, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States; and we will be launching VTLs with Malaysia, Finland, and Sweden from 29 November 2021. Travellers under the VTLs are not subject to Stay-Home Notice (SHN) on arrival. Instead, they will be required to produce a negative Pre-Departure Test taken within two days prior to departure and undergo an on-arrival PCR test.  19.     We intend to launch VTLs with India and Indonesia from 29 November 2021 and with Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 6 December 2021. Vaccinated Travel Pass (VTP) applications for Short-Term Visitors and Long-Term Pass Holders will commence on 22 November 2021 for travellers from India and Indonesia; and 29 November for travellers from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and UAE. Returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents who are fully vaccinated will not need to apply for VTP in order to make use of the VTLs for travel. Travellers intending to travel from Singapore to these VTL countries / regions are advised to check the prevailing entry requirements of the destination. 20.     The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore will provide more details separately. Moving Steadily Towards a COVID-19 Resilient Singapore 21.     As we continue to adjust our measures progressively for a safe re-opening, we seek everyone’s continued effort and cooperation to exercise social responsibility and comply with all the VDS conditions and SMMs we have put in place. Test yourself regularly and follow the necessary health protocols. If you are offered a vaccination or booster dose, please also come forward and get vaccinated. This will ensure that our limited healthcare resources are effectively allocated to those in need and pave the way for us to be a COVID-19 resilient nation.  MINISTRY OF HEALTH15 NOVEMBER 2021 [1] An individual is considered fully vaccinated if he / she has received the appropriate regimen of World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines including their respective duration post-vaccination for the vaccine to be fully effective and had their vaccination records ingested in MOH’s national IT systems.[2] With the exception of recovered workers. ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/extending-vds-enabled-activities-vaccinated-travel-lanes-and-recreation-activities-for-migrant-workers-as-part-of-calibrated-easing-in-stabilisation-phase,

Among those hospitalised, the majority recovered quickly without requiring oxygen therapy or intensive care.KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) and National University Hospital (NUH) are the two public hospitals with paediatric beds as well as healthcare professionals trained in providing specialised care for sick children. They operate a total of 32 paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) beds, with non-Covid-19 cases taking up between one-third and two-thirds occupancy on average.There are 21 paediatric ICU specialists of different seniority and about 160 PICU trained nurses at KKH and NUH to provide paediatric intensive care.Should the need arise, the number of PICU beds can be ramped up progressively for Covid-19 cases.KKH and NUH also conduct regular skills upgrading and refresher training to equip their healthcare teams with PICU skills.Adopting mask wearing, personal hygiene practices such as hand washing with soap and water, and safe management measures will be crucial to protecting a child from Covid-19 infection.The Expert Committee on Covid-19 Vaccination is also studying the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine for children aged five to 11 in Singapore.

However, the Survey has highlighted some areas of concern, including the rising prevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia, higher body mass index (BMI) and overall lower physical activity.2.     The results of the NPHS are a reminder for Singaporeans to continue engaging in healthy lifestyle habits amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) will continue to support Singaporeans to stay healthy. We encourage Singaporeans to take ownership of your health and play your part in leading a healthier lifestyle.Results of NPHS 2020Chronic disease continues to be a concern3.     The prevalence of hypertension and hyperlipidaemia showed an increasing trend over the years. During the period of 2019 to 2020, over one in three (35.5%) had hypertension, and about four in 10 (39.1%) had hyperlipidaemia (or high blood cholesterol) compared to about one in four (24.2%) and slightly more than one in three (35.5%) in 2017 respectively. The increasing trend was observed even after adjusting for the possible effect of an ageing population3. The increase in prevalence for both conditions was greatest among those 40 years and above. While the crude prevalence of diabetes showed a slight increase from 8.8% in 2017 to 9.5% for the period of 2019 to 2020, a stable trend was seen after adjusting for age4.More were obese or had high risk BMI, and fewer engaged in sufficient total physical activity4.     During the period of 2019 to 2020, over one in 10 (10.5%) Singapore residents were obese5 and over two in 10 (20.7%) had high risk BMI6. This is a slight increase from 20177.The prevalence of obesity and high risk BMI was more common among adults aged 30 to 59 years, almost double that of those aged 18 to 29 years.5.     From the survey, fewer Singapore residents were engaged in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week8 in 2020 (76.4%)9, compared to 2017 (80.9%), despite the increase in the number of Singapore residents engaging in leisure-time regular exercise10 in 2020 (33.4%) compared to 2017 (29.4%). Similar trends were also observed after adjusting for age11.Smoking prevalence continues to decrease while binge drinking has increased6.     Smoking prevalence has seen a steady decline over the past decade. The NPHS results showed that smoking prevalence for Singapore residents has decreased to 10.1% in 2020, from 11.8% in 2017.7.     However, the crude prevalence of binge drinking12 has increased in 2020 (10.5%), compared to 2017 (8.8%). This increase was seen mainly in the younger age groups, particularly among individuals aged 18 to 29 years and 30 to 39 years.Slight decrease in chronic disease screening rates while screening for colorectal cancer and breast cancer increased8.     In 2020, 63% of Singapore residents aged 40 to 74 years with no previous diagnosis of diabetes, high blood pressure and high blood cholesterol were screened for all three health conditions within the recommended frequency. This was a slight decrease from 66.4% in 2017.9.     Screening rates for colorectal cancer increased in 2020 (41.1%), compared to 2017 (35.0%). Similarly, screening rates of breast cancer screening increased in 2020 (37.9%) compared to 2017 (30.9%). Screening rates for cervical cancer remained stable in 2020 (45.4%) compared to 2017 (46.3%).Influenza and Pneumococcal Vaccination Coverage has increased10.     Influenza vaccination13 coverage among Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years showed an increase from 13.1% in 2017 to 17.0% in 2020. While vaccination rates increased across all age groups, adults aged 18 to 29 years and 60 to 74 years had the highest influenza vaccination coverage compared to other age groups.11.     Similarly, Pneumococcal vaccination14 coverage among elderly aged 65 to 74 years increased from 11.9% in 2017 to 14.4% in 2020.Prevalence of poor mental health remained stable12.     The crude prevalence of poor mental health15 among Singapore residents remained stable in 2020 (13.4%) compared to 2017 (12.5%). A similar trend was observed for age adjusted prevalence16. Younger adults aged 18 to 29 years had the highest proportion (21.5%) with poor mental health while the prevalence for other age groups were lower.Findings highlight pressing need for action13.     The NPHS 2020 findings highlight the need to build upon our ongoing health promotion efforts while moving ahead to innovate new ways to empower the population to take charge of their health, especially as Singaporeans' behaviours may have changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will continue to press on in the following areas:a) Encouraging Singaporeans to increase physical activity and adopt a heathier diet14.     An observed increase in prevalence in obesity and high risk BMI can potentially increase the risk of developing chronic diseases. Aside from genetic factors, obesity can also result from a lack of physical activity and an unhealthy diet. To encourage Singaporeans to be more active, we will continue to improve accessibility to our regular exercise programmes, such as bringing the programmes online and creating more exercise sessions in available community spaces. We will also encourage Singaporeans to lead more active lifestyles through population-wide programmes such as the National Steps Challenge.15.     With the increase in hypertension prevalence, we need to do more to reduce sodium consumption in our diets. Salt is the primary source of sodium, and high sodium intake is associated with increased risk of hypertension. Singapore residents are consuming 3,600mg of sodium per day on average in 2018, higher than before17, and 9 in 10 Singapore residents exceeded the World Health Organization’s (WHO) recommendation to consume less than 2,000mg of sodium per day (i.e. no more than 1 teaspoon of regular salt). To address this issue, HPB is planning to ramp up existing efforts to spur reformulation of reduced-sodium sauces and seasonings, and embark on a nationwide campaign to encourage Singaporeans to reduce sodium consumption in their diets. More details will be released in the coming months.16.     To promote healthier diets, we also need to do more to reduce our sugar intake. To help Singaporeans reduce their sugar intake from beverages and spur industry reformulation, we announced in October 2019 that we would be introducing mandatory nutrition labels, also known as ‘Nutri-Grade’, and advertising prohibitions on pre-packaged non-alcoholic beverages sold in Singapore. These measures will come into effect from Q4 2022 onwards to allow the industry more time to comply with the measures and reformulate their products given disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also working on extending these measures to freshly prepared beverages, which is a key and growing source of sugar in our diets. More information will be made available in the coming months.17.     These efforts will work in tandem with other ongoing efforts such as the Healthier Choice Symbol, Healthier Dining Programme and Eat, Drink, Shop Healthy Challenge to create an ecosystem to support individuals in making healthier food choices.b) Efforts targeted at smoking and binge drinking will continue18.     While we have seen a reduction in smoking prevalence, we will continue our efforts to keep smoking prevalence low. We will be enhancing our educational efforts in mainstream schools to prevent smoking initiation from young while continuing to help smokers quit through our smoking cessation programmes. In addition to our programmes, policies such as Minimum Legal Age 21 and standardised packaging for all tobacco products form part of a multi-pronged approach to tobacco control, which aim to reduce smoking among our youth and young adults.19.     To target binge drinking, we will continue our educational efforts in mainstream schools and Institutes of Higher Learning on the harmful effects of alcohol consumption while continuing collaborations with industry partners to include pertinent messages on responsible drinking in their campaigns.c) Encouraging early detection through regular screening20.     It is important to go for regular, recommended health screening for early detection of diseases so as to enable early intervention. As part of Screen for Life (SFL) programme, eligible Singapore residents are offered heavily subsidised screening tests for cardiovascular risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia), cervical cancer and colorectal cancer at no more than $5 for the screening tests, screening visit and first follow-up consultation (if required). We will continue our efforts to reach out to the unscreened population, to encourage Singaporeans to participate in screening regularly.d) Encouraging vaccination uptake21.     Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination is recommended in the National Adult Immunisation Schedule (NAIS) to prevent serious complications and death among high risk groups such as the elderly and persons with certain medical conditions. The increase in uptake is promising. All persons who have been recommended to receive the vaccination should take it up to protect themselves. To encourage further uptake, since November 2020, subsidies have been extended to these vaccination as recommended under the NAIS for eligible Singaporean adults, and made more accessible through CHAS GP clinics as well as polyclinics. In partnership with healthcare professionals, HPB and other stakeholders, we will continue to reach out and promote the uptake of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination among these groups.e) Supporting better mental health and wellbeing22.     Taking into consideration the increased stress and worry that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, there is a greater need to improve the population’s mental wellbeing and foster a conducive environment for support. The COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce (CoMWT) has made recommendations to develop a national mental health and well-being strategy, a national mental health resource portal to help individuals access useful and accurate information, and a national mental health competency training framework to align and standardise training curriculums on mental health in the community. These recommendations will be implemented under the new Interagency Taskforce on Mental Health and Well-being. In addition, HPB continues to offer mental wellness programmes at schools, workplaces and community, aimed at helping Singaporeans cope with challenges faced in the new normal23.     To further address the concerns of youth mental health issues, the Youth Mental Well-being Network was formed in February 2020 and brought together over 1,500 passionate like-minded individuals including mental health professionals, practitioners, parents and youths, to work on projects to support youth mental health. The Network is supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), MOH and the Ministry of Education (MOE). In addition, MOH and the Agency for Integrated Care(AIC), together with community partners, have set up youth community outreach teams to reach out to youths in mental distress to provide basic emotional support and resources, and link them with social and health services.Let’s take charge of our health24.     As we adjust to living with COVID-19, MOH and HPB will continue to working closely with various agencies to create an ecosystem that enables Singaporeans to live healthy lifestyles. Many of these efforts will take time to show longer term health outcomes, and we will continue to push on with our efforts, such as those under the War on Diabetes.25.     To empower people to take charge of their health, we are also leveraging technology, such as HealthHub which offers a wide range of reliable and locally relevant content to improve their health literacy. This allows individuals to take charge of the health of their families and themselves, through using secure and personalised health information and tools. More tips, resources and programmes are available for from HealthHub at www.healthhub.sg.26.     As health is ultimately a personal responsibility, everyone has a role to play in achieving and sustaining better health of our nation. Individuals can play a part by making conscious decisions towards a healthier lifestyle.27.     The full NPHS 2020 report is available on the MOH website at https://www.moh.gov.sg/resources-statistics/reports/national-survey-2019-20 .MINISTRY OF HEALTH18 NOVEMBER 2021___________________________________________________________________[1] Singapore Residents aged 18 to 74 years old.[2] The fieldwork was completed before Circuit Breaker which took place between 7 April 2020 and 1 June 2020.[3] Age-standardised prevalence for hypertension has increased from 21.9% in 2017 to 31.7% during 2019-2020, while the age-standardised prevalence for hyperlipidaemia has increased from 33.8% in 2017 to 36.9% during 2019-2020.[4] Age-standardised prevalence for diabetes was 7.8% in 2017 and 7.9% during 2019-2020.[5] Obese refers to BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2[6] Recognising that the risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus starts from a lower BMI for Asian populations, the WHO expert consultation recommended an additional classification of BMI for public health action among Asians where having a BMI ≥ 27.5 kg/m2 was considered as having high risk BMI.[7] In NPHS 2017, 8.6% were obese and 18.7% had high risk BMI.[8] Based on WHO's recommended level of physical activity, and indicated as sufficient total physical activity in the NPHS report.[9] In 2020, the largest contributor to total physical activity was commuting (49.6%), followed by leisure-time physical activity (26.8%) and work-related physical activity (23.6%).[10] Leisure-time regular exercise refers to the participation in any sports or exercise for ≥ 20 minutes per occasion for ≥ 3 days a week.[11] Age-standardised prevalence for Singapore residents engaging in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week has decreased from 80.9% in 2017 to 76.8% during 2020, while the age-standardised prevalence for leisure-time regular exercise has increased from 29.8% in 2017 to 33.8% during 2020.[12] Binge drinking refers to consumption of five or more alcoholic drinks for males or four or more alcoholic drinks for females in any one drinking session during the past month preceding the survey.[13] Influenza vaccination coverage refers to Singapore residents aged 18 to 74 years who reported having had an influenza injection in the past 12 months. Annual influenza vaccination is part of the nationally recommended vaccinations for individuals at risk of serious flu complications including the elderly, young children and people with certain chronic conditions.[14] The National Adult Immunisation Schedule (2017) recommends all persons aged 65 years or older to be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.[15] A 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) was used to measure mental health. A respondent is identified to have poor mental health if he or she have a score of 3 or more from the questionnaire.[16] Age-standardised rate for poor mental health prevalence was 13.8% in 2020 and 12.6% in 2017.[17] Based on National Nutrition Survey 2010, Singapore residents’ average daily sodium intake is 3,000mg.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/smoking-rates-down-chronic-disease-prevalence-remains-of-concern,

Let me try to explain the situation we are in and how we came to these set of decisions. We have come to a critical juncture in our battle against COVID-19. Be mindful that we are still going through a fairly big wave of transmission, which started in the last week of August. In the last week of August, there were about 100 cases a day, and it went through five cycles of doubling and reached a seven-day moving average of around 3,200 in end-October, and it peaked then.2. After the peak, the daily cases stabilised, and started to come down, and as it comes down, you will then notice the week-on-week infection ratio has been falling below 1.0. That prompted the MTF to relax the rules quite cautiously last week, to allow five persons from the same household to dine together. For the past eleven days we watched the situation very closely, and thankfully and fortunately, cases did not go up. And in fact, it was even more subdued.3. As we come to the end of the Stabilisation Phase, we have to decide our next steps. I will further explain the pandemic situation, while Minister Lawrence Wong will further elaborate on the measures we are taking. I will run through a few indicators.4. Number one, is the stock of patients. As the number of infections come down, so has the total stock of patients in our system. Most of them – a great majority – are on the Home Recovery Programme (HRP). It has stayed consistently above 20,000 patients at any one time throughout October, peaking at 26,386 on 29 October. Since then, it has been decreasing. It dipped below 20,000 on 7 November, and now it is just over 15,000. Every day, we continue to discharge about 3,000 patients – also a majority from HRP.5. Second indicator – the reproduction number of the disease, or R. This has been held at around 0.9 to 1. And I want to mention that we held R at about 0.9 to 1 despite a very noticeable increase in footfall throughout the island over the past one to two weeks, because more and more people are coming out and socialising. And in fact, today the footfall that we measure across popular destinations is only about 5 percent less than at the peak of the Preparatory Phase in early September. And if you remember, during the Preparatory Phase we allowed 5 persons dining. This is a good sign. It means that more human activity did not drive infections and hospitalisations up. And what it means is this – that our society is becoming more resilient to the virus.6. The third indicator is severe illnesses. At the peak of our current transmission wave, the average number of patients hospitalised, needing oxygen supplementation or ICU care, was about 420. That was the stock number at the peak. Now it is around 370. If we zoom into just ICU, we had about 140 patients during the last week of October, at the peak of this transmission. This has come down to about 110 now.7. Next, incidence of severe illnesses. Very importantly, the incidence of patients falling severely ill, needing ICU care or died, has come down. So we track that number longitudinally from August to September to October. The number has fallen from 12 per 1,000 infected individuals, to six per 1,000 and then to five per 1,000 respectively. And it is likely that if we track beyond October, to have a November number, I think very likely, it will go even below five. And this is significant, which means that every time you get 1,000 people infected, you can now count on the fact that a fewer number will fall severely ill, needing ICU care, or die compared to August or September, when the number was higher then.8. What has contributed to this decline is the increased uptake of boosters by vaccinated seniors, and therefore even if they are infected, with boosters, they are less likely to fall severely ill. But more importantly, is that fewer unvaccinated seniors are now getting infected. For every 1,000 people who are infected now, you expect fewer unvaccinated seniors amongst that 1,000. That impact is direct and significant, because this group of unvaccinated seniors, is 1 percent of our total population, 6 percent of population of our seniors, but two-thirds of the population in ICUs.9. At its peak, on 19 October, we had 119 unvaccinated seniors infected that day. Many of them ended up in ICU or died. In the last week of October, the number has eased to an average of 60 cases a day. In the past week, we have less than 40 cases of unvaccinated seniors being infected a day.10. Why has the number fallen? A lot of work has gone in to bring this about.11. Number one, the population of unvaccinated seniors continues to shrink as our vaccination teams continue to reach out to them, even in their homes. In end October, we had 65,000 unvaccinated seniors who are 60 years and above. As of today, we have gone below 60,000. In fact, about just slightly above 59,000. So 5,000 more became fully vaccinated in a matter of two weeks, and I think many lives were saved as a result.12. Second, number two, due to our Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS). Because of VDS, unvaccinated seniors are restricted in their access to crowded places, especially in places where people tend to pull down their masks and talk, such as dining at hawker centres and coffee shops, and so they are now much less likely to be exposed to the virus. And in order to resume their activities, many of them chose to walk into our vaccination centres and get themselves vaccinated, which is a very good thing.13. In summary, we are in a better position compared to end-October, the peak of the transmission wave. But it is early days, and we are far from out of the woods. We still have a couple of thousands of infections a day, and people continue to be admitted to ICU and every day, we do see people die. We know all these continue to worry many Singaporeans. Our bicycle has slowed down its descent to a controllable pace, but it is still some distance away from safety.14. As we look down the slope on our bicycle, it is a steep slope down still. But we know we have a few brakes at our disposal and can work effectively in the coming weeks and months.15. One, is our booster programme which is gathering pace. We have administered over 1.2 million doses, covering 21 percent of our population. At some point, we will need everyone who has two doses of the vaccine to get a third one. And indeed, with the Delta variant now, there is an emerging view among the clinical and scientific communities globally that this is really a three-dose vaccine, just like Hepatitis B.16. We have thus far administered boosters after at least a five-month interval for seniors, and six months for those aged 30 to 59. Our Expert Committee has further studied the latest international data and has now recommended that we can standardise at five months for all age groups. We will begin this new arrangement from 24 November.17. With this change, from now to end December, we hope to administer about 1.5 million doses of boosters, raising our coverage from 21 percent of our population to about 50 percent. This means by year end, half of our population will be freshly boosted with high levels of antibodies.18. In addition, many more individuals will recover safely from COVID-19 infections and add to our societal resilience. For the few remaining unvaccinated, it is not too late to come forward and get yourself vaccinated.19. We also now have a strong VDS system already in place, to protect the vulnerable, and we are further rolling it out to hawker centres and then coffee shops. This makes a world of difference, as I mentioned earlier, it makes sure that for every 1,000 infections, fewer and fewer unvaccinated seniors are amongst them. We need to implement it well and we need to seek the understanding of everyone, that we need to do this.20. There is one more additional consideration, which is timing. We are now in end-November. When we cross to December, there is a certain mood, and then we are moving closer towards year-end festivities, and there will be pent-up demand to want to go out. So as far as possible, we do not want to do an opening move that is significant in the month of December. Because we risk, once opening, social activities will spike up very high, and it can drive and spark off a new wave. So if we can open up earlier, to allow society, families, friends, to gradually ease into a festive mood.21. We therefore have before us a valuable window of opportunity for us to open up further. It will likely lead to more social interactions, which will increase the circulation of the virus. It may also result in more cases daily and even more hospitalisations. However, the impact of this – on the healthcare system, healthcare outcomes – will be counteracted by the three things I just mentioned – boosters – that is gathering pace – safe recovery from COVID-19 and then VDS.22. If we miss this window and delay opening until next year, the protection from boosters against infection and symptomatic disease may weaken by then, and the case numbers and public health outcome will likely be worse than if we open up now. That is why we come to the decision today, that we will make a move to open up from two persons per group, to five persons per group.23.

This restriction will apply to those who have obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore. b.    Returning Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents will be subjected to a 10-day SHN at dedicated SDF. c.     South Africa will be placed in Category IV1. 5.             These additional border restrictions will apply for four weeks in the first instance, after which we will review and extend the restrictions if necessary. 6.             As mentioned, while the variant has been suggested to be more transmissible, there is currently insufficient evidence to determine if this variant is associated with any change in disease severity, antibody response or vaccine efficacy. These aspects are being investigated. The Ministry of Health will evaluate the data as it emerges and review our border measures accordingly. 7.             The updated country/region classification and its corresponding border measure may be found in Annex A. The full list of Safe Travel Lanes for travel to Singapore and prevailing border measures under each lane for different categories and changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website.

MediFund Silver and MediFund Junior were introduced in 2007 and 2013 respectively to provide more targeted assistance for the elderly and children respectively. MediFund ensures that no Singaporean will be denied basic medical care due to inability to pay.3.     The amount disbursed by MediFund in FY2020 was $2.2 million lower than the $159.1 million disbursed in FY2019. The decrease in assistance was mainly due to lower number of patient visits to the Public Healthcare Institutions (PHIs) and Intermediate and Long-term Care (ILTC) facilities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The key statistics of MediFund assistance provided in FY2020 are:   The number of approved MediFund applications was 1,150,985. This was a 5.3% decrease from the 1,215,809 number of approved applications in FY2019, contributed by a decrease in the total number of applications over the same period[1];     In PHIs, a total assistance of $120.3 million was provided to patients, compared to $122.8 million in FY2019;  In ILTC facilities, a total assistance of $36.6 million was provided to patients, compared to $36.2 million in FY2019; and  On average, the amount of MediFund assistance provided was $841 per inpatient treatment, and $93 per outpatient treatment.  4.     More details can be found in the Medical Endowment Scheme Annual Report 2020/2021.  MINISTRY OF HEALTH 30 NOVEMBER 2021    [1] Total applications in FY2020 decreased by about 4.0% compared to FY2019.

The number of cases reported is 10% lower than the same period (January to October) in 2020 and could be related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic since early 2020. 2.             The Ministry of Health (MOH) has analysed 119 cases that were reported in the first 6 months (January – June) of 2021. Of these cases: i.        93% were male;ii.       48% were 20-39 years and 33% were 40-59 years; andiii.      60% had late-stage HIV infection2 at diagnosis. This is 6% higher compared to the same period last year. 3.              Sexual intercourse remains the main mode of HIV transmission, accounting for 94% of the 119 cases. Homosexual transmission was the mode of transmission for 55% of all cases, while 35% were from heterosexual transmission and 4% from bisexual transmission. 4.              The majority of newly reported cases (57%) were detected by HIV tests performed in the course of medical care3, typically at a late stage of HIV infection. Another 15% were detected during routine programmatic HIV screening4 while 21% were detected through self-initiated HIV screening. The rest were detected through other forms of screening. A higher proportion of homosexuals/bisexuals (30%) had their HIV infection detected via self-initiated HIV screening compared to heterosexuals (10%). 5.             Annex A provides detailed data for cases reported from 1985 to June 2021. Information on newly reported HIV cases is regularly updated on the MOH website. Public Advisory 6.             The most effective way to prevent HIV infection is to avoid casual sex. Persons engaging in high-risk sexual behaviour, such as having multiple sexual partners or engaging in casual or commercial sex, are strongly advised to use condoms to reduce their risk of HIV infection and other sexually transmitted infections. Condoms should be used consistently and correctly during every sexual encounter. 7.             MOH and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) urge individuals at risk of HIV infection to go for regular HIV testing5. Regular HIV testing and early diagnosis can facilitate early treatment and care. This would also provide an opportunity for infected persons to protect their partners from infection, as HIV-positive individuals who are on treatment and have an undetectable viral load have practically no risk of transmitting the virus to their sexual partners. With early and effective treatment, persons living with HIV can continue to lead active and productive lives. 8.             HPB has been working with partner organisations to conduct programmes and campaigns to encourage high-risk individuals to take proactive measures, such as going for early and regular HIV testing. Adopting a lifestyle-based approach, these programmes engage high-risk individuals via social settings to increase the targeted reach.

These persons are eligible for their third dose from three months after their second dose.2.   To maintain their fully vaccinated status from 1 January 2022 onwards,they are strongly encouraged to take their third dose before 31 December 2021, as long as their second dose had been administered three months ago. Beyond this time interval, the individual’s vaccination status will revert to ‘additional dose needed’ and will be subject to the current Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) [2],as well as the Workforce Vaccination Measures, both of which will take effect on 1 January 2022. Individuals should bear in mind the following:a) Individuals who have already received two doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccines are strongly recommended to receive a PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccine for their third dose unless they are medically ineligible to do so. They can walk into any vaccination centre offering the mRNA vaccines to receive their third dose. The list of vaccination centre offering mRNA vaccines can be found on www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations-vcs. b) Otherwise, they should complete their primary series with a third dose of the Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccines, whichever was received for the first two doses. The Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine can be taken at any of the PSAR-authorised private clinics. The list of PSAR-authorised private clinics can be found on www.vaccine.gov.sg/locations. 3.   Persons who developed an allergic reaction to the first dose of the mRNA vaccine and received the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine for their second dose should also complete a third dose of Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, 28 days after their second dose, to maintain their vaccination status.4.   The three-dose requirement applies to individuals who have had one dose of the Sinovac-CoronaVac or Sinopharm vaccines, as part of a two-dose combination of different World Health Organization’s Emergency Use Listing (WHO-EUL) vaccine brands [3].

Hence, only fully vaccinated, recovered, or medically ineligible individuals, or children aged 12 years and below (i.e. those born in 2010 or after), will be allowed to enter settings and participate in activities where VDS are implemented [4]. 6.   A grace period will be extended to children born in December 2009 to allow them sufficient time to get fully vaccinated. Children born in 2009 who will turn 13 in 2022 will need to be fully vaccinated to enter venues and participate in activities with VDS from 1 March 2022 (instead of 1 January 2022).Workforce Vaccination Measures7.   With the implementation of the Workforce Vaccination Measures from 1 January 2022, we will also phase out the “Vaccinate or Regular Test” regime for all sectors that were onboard the regime as of the same date. 8.   We continue to strongly recommend persons who can take the PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccines to do so given its higher vaccine effectiveness against infection and severe disease.   MINISTRY OF HEALTH2 DECEMBER 2021  Note: Paragraph 2 has been updated on 4 December 2021 [1] As of 30 November 2021. [2] https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2021/1023-implementation-of-workforce-vaccination-measures[3] Excluding the Johnson & Johnson/ Janssen single-dose COVID-19 vaccine.[4] Subject to venue and/or event-specific capacities.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/reminder-to-complete-primary-series-of-sinovac-coronavac-and-sinopharm-vaccines_2Dec2021,

Since then, a growing number of countries/regions have reported Omicron cases. Singapore is no exception. We have preliminarily detected two imported COVID-19 cases with the Omicron variant. They are both fully vaccinated, experiencing mild symptoms, and currently recovering at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). The National Public Health Laboratory is conducting whole genome sequencing to confirm the Omicron variant. All other passengers who came into Singapore on the same flight have tested negative for COVID-19 on arrival and are quarantined under SHN at designated facilities. They will undergo PCR tests at the end of their SHN. 3. We expect to see more Omicron cases being reported globally in the weeks to come. We are coordinating with health authorities globally to study and understand the Omicron variant. While we do so, we will further augment our testing regime for travellers. Should the Omicron variant be more transmissible than Delta and become the globally dominant variant over time, it is a matter of time before it establishes itself in Singapore. But the additional measures will help to buy time to learn more about dealing with Omicron, and to continue with our booster programme to strengthen our collective resilience for better protection against this new variant.  Update on Assessment of Omicron Variant 4. As of 2 December 2021, the Omicron variant has been detected in at least 28 other countries, mainly from persons with recent travel history to southern Africa. There is currently no evidence to suggest that symptoms associated with the Omicron variant are different or more severe than those of other variants, or that current vaccines and therapeutics would be ineffective against Omicron. More data and further studies are needed to verify this.5. We have also been closely monitoring studies on the sensitivity of Antigen Rapid Tests (ARTs) to the Omicron variant. Preliminary validation by the manufacturers show that ARTs remain effective in detecting COVID-19 cases of the Omicron variant, and laboratories are doing further biochemical tests to confirm these results. These initial results lend confidence that ARTs remain effective as a method of detecting COVID-19, including Omicron cases. Updates to Border Measures Review of Country/Region Classifications6. Due to the situation in Bulgaria, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway and Poland, these countries will be placed in Category III from 6 December 2021, 2359 hours.Expansion of Travel Restrictions to Additional Affected Countries/Regions 7. To further step up our precautionary stance amidst growing transmissions of Omicron globally, we will extend travel restrictions to more countries which have seen a spike in Omicron cases. From 4 December 2021, 2359 hours, all long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to Ghana, Malawi and Nigeria within the last 14 days will not be allowed to enter Singapore, or transfer/ transit through Singapore. This restriction will apply to those who have obtained prior approval for entry into Singapore. We will apply these restrictions for four weeks in the first instance, after which we will review and extend them if necessary.Self-Administered ART for Travellers on Vaccinated Travel Lanes8. Currently, all VTL travellers entering Singapore by air are to take an On-Arrival PCR test, followed by supervised ART tests on Days 3 and 7. We will augment this testing regime with effect from 6 December 2021, 2359 hours. 9. The enhanced ART protocol draws reference from the prevailing Health Protocol 3 which is in place for all who are identified as close contacts of an infected person.  Essentially, besides the Pre-Departure and On-Arrival Tests, all travellers on VTL will be put on a daily testing regime over 7 days using ART. The tests are all self-administered, and travellers will be required to submit the results of their self-administered ART online using a link which will be sent to them via their declared contact details after arrival in Singapore. However, on Days 3 and 7, the tests will have to be done under supervision at a Combined Test Centre (CTC) or Quick Test Centre (QTC).2 Day 3 is the median incubation period, and Day 7 is the day of exit from this testing protocol. During this 7-day period, other than on days when they go out for their supervised tests, these travellers must test negative on their self-administered ART before going out for activities on that day.10. The above 7-day enhanced ART protocols will also apply to travellers arriving from Malaysia via VTL-Land from 6 December 2021, 2359 hours. The additional measures will further enhance the current testing protocols for VTL-Land, which include a Pre-Departure Test and an On-Arrival ART. 11. The testing regime for all VTL travellers from 6 December 2021, 2359 hours3 is summarised in Table 1 below. This enhanced testing regime will remain in place for four weeks in the first instance, i.e. until 2 January 2022, 2359 hours.Table 1: Testing regime for VTL travellers (dates illustrative based on arrival on 7 December 2021)   Day   Date   Test     Within 2 days before departure    On or after 5 December 2021   Pre-Departure PCR test or ART     1 (arrival)   7 December 2021   On-Arrival PCR test (for VTL-Air) or ART (for VTL-Land)     2   8 December 2021   Unsupervised self-administered ART*     3   9 December 2021   Supervised self-administered ART at QTC/CTC^     4   10 December 2021   Unsupervised self-administered ART*     5   11 December 2021   Unsupervised self-administered ART*     6   12 December 2021   Unsupervised self-administered ART*     7   13 December 2021   Supervised self-administered ART at QTC/CTC^   *Results to be submitted online.Regular Review of Border Measures12. The full set of Safe Travel Lanes for travel to Singapore and prevailing border measures under each lane for different categories will be updated on the SafeTravel website. Not all lanes may utilise the Category I/II/III/IV health measure framework. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures for the associated country or region before entering Singapore, and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry into Singapore.13. All travellers are reminded to accurately declare their travel history. Strict enforcement actions will be taken against false declarations.Being Prepared to Respond Nimbly to Omicron14. Our tightened border measures will help to limit importation and onward transmission of Omicron cases as we continue to study the variant’s characteristics. However, given its high transmissibility and spread to many parts of the world, we should expect to find more cases at our borders and, in time to come, also within our community. We will press on with our booster programme to best prepare our community for any eventuality. We will monitor and evaluate data on the Omicron variant as it emerges and need to remain nimble in our responses. We seek Singaporeans’ understanding and support in the coming weeks as we will need to introduce or change our measures at short notice, in response to the fluid situation. Annex A[1] Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Please refer to the Press Release on 26 November 2021.[2] VTL travellers will be provided with a link via their contact details submitted in the Singapore Arrival Card and electronic Health Declaration Card (SGAC/eHDC) to book their supervised tests on Days 3 and 7. Bookings will be on a first-come-first-served basis.[3] Travellers who have entered Singapore between 3 December 2021 and 6 December 2021 (inclusive) are not required to undergo the self-administered ARTs on Days 2, 4, 5 and 6 of their arrival, but will continue to be required to take the supervised self-administered ARTs at QTCs or CTCs on Days 3 and 7 of their arrival.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/strengthening-our-precautionary-measures-against-the-omicron-variant,

It is my pleasure to join you today at Public Free Clinic Society’s (PFCS’s) 47th anniversary celebrations. Over the past 47 years, PFCS has been providing affordable TCM treatment to the lower income. I would like to express my gratitude and congratulations to PFCS’s President Mr Loh Kooi Cheng and all directors, TCM physicians and staff. I hope that PFCS will continue its charitable spirit and remain steadfast in its philosophy of offering affordable and good quality Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) services to all Singaporeans. 2.     The world is facing the public health crisis of the century since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020. In Singapore, it has been over 20 months into the fight against COVID-19 and I would like to thank you for your cooperation and support, adhering to the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) advisories and encouraging your elderly patients to come forward to get vaccinated. As of mid-November 2021, we have administered more than 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines and our vaccination rate at 85% is one of the highest in the world. As healthcare professionals, I hope that eligible TCM practitioners (TCMPs) will also register for your booster vaccination and encourage your elderly patients to do the same so as to further reduce their risk of severe outcomes such as developing severe illness and death. Let us all continue to work together and do our part, so that we can transit to living with COVID-19 sooner.3.     TCM has its unique theory on health and disease prevention. At a time when Singapore's population is ageing rapidly, chronic diseases are becoming more common and new infectious diseases are emerging, TCM plays an important complementary role in Singapore’s healthcare system. I understand that nearly 80 per cent of PFCS’s patients are aged above 50 years. To better provide TCM treatment for these patients, PFCS has set up a Geriatrics TCM Treatment Centre to cater to their healthcare needs to better manage symptoms of chronic diseases and other conditions such as aches and pain, poor appetite and insomnia. Since the Centre opened in 2019, over 600 elderly patients have benefitted from its service. However due to COVID-19 restrictions, these services have been suspended and we hope it can resume soon.4.     We live in a fast-paced, data-driven era where there is abundance of information, and greater inter-disciplinary interactions. To keep up with times, TCMPs must continually learn and apply new knowledge and skills, to better treat patients and further their careers. The development of TCM in Singapore is closely linked to training and talent development of TCMPs. Hence, we are working with major TCM organisations to set up two workgroups. The first is to review and look into the feasibility of enhancing our local clinical training programme for newly registered TCMPs, for example by setting up a standardised training curriculum and assessment framework, including possible clinical rotation with participating TCM institutions. The other workgroup will look into how we can enhance the employability and career development of TCMPs, so as to retain young talents in the field of TCM, through different pathways to support those involved in roles like management, research or teaching. I have met with the members of the two workgroups at end November and I look forward to their recommendations on supporting the long-term sustainability and development of TCM in Singapore.5.     Looking ahead, the future development of TCM requires the continuous collective effort of the government and stakeholders in the TCM sector. I hope our efforts will contribute to the continued growth and progress of TCM in Singapore to better serve the people. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Singaporeans from all walks of life for their continued support to PFCS, which has enabled PFCS to continue serving the people. Once again, I congratulate PFCS on their contributions over the past 47 years, and hope that they will continue to work hard to raise the professional standards of their TCMPs and promote the development of TCM. Thank you.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-dr-koh-poh-koon-senior-minister-of-state-ministry-of-health-at-public-free-clinic-society's-47th-anniversary-ceremony-5-december-2021-2.00pm-at-public-free-clinic-society-headquarters,

During the present wave of infection, we wanted to ensure that the ratio was below 1 before we eased any restrictions. As the present wave subsides and infection numbers start to stabilise, we can expect the ratio to trend towards 1.  15.     We will continue to monitor this indicator to get a sense of how quickly the virus is spreading in the community. For example if the ratio were to rise rapidly beyond 1 on a sustained basis, then it would mean an acceleration in the spread of infection, and potentially the start of a new wave of transmission.  16.     MOH will continue to update the public on significant developments, including information on the Omicron variant, through regular media statements.

You worked tirelessly to alleviate the sufferings of patients who were very severely ill. You stepped forward and provided care and comfort to patients at home.  Hospices pivoted to virtual platforms to conduct programmes, befriending services and tele-consultations to continue supporting patients’ well-being. 5 So thank you for stepping up so competently, in the nation’s hour of need. Rising Importance of Palliative Care6 Beyond COVID-19, we need to raise the awareness of the importance of palliative care.  To do so, we need to address the mismatch of expectations and desires that exist today. 7 Let me explain. Given the typical decline in a patient’s health towards the end of life, a large part of our lifetime healthcare expenditure is actually incurred in the last 90 days of our lives.  I raise this not as a financial issue, but for us to appreciate the amount of drugs we have to take, the surgeries we have to go through and the number of tubes attached to our bodies, as we approach the end of our lives. The question is whether this is truly what we want our journeys in life to end. 8 From the perspective of some many loved ones, we hold dear to values that emphasise filial piety, familial support and care. Many of us will do whatever we can to ensure that our family members, often our elders, receive the best possible care to recover from their illnesses, however slim the chances are.  9 But from the perspective of the elderly patient, many prefer to spend their last days in the comfort of their homes, in a familiar environment and in the presence of loved ones. Going through traumatic treatments and then dying alone in a hospital, is the last thing they want.  Yet this is what many have to go through. 10 We need to reconcile these two desires and the answer lies in the advancement of palliative care and raising the awareness of its importance.  National Strategy for Palliative Care11 The Ministry of Health (MOH) has developed a National Strategy for palliative care.  This has allowed us to make good progress in enabling dignified, and for lack of a better word, good quality of death.  12 According to the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Quality of Death Index, Singapore improved from 18th to 12th out of 40 countries from 2010 to 2015 and we are now ranked 2nd in Asia.13 We will continue to evolve and improve our National Strategy for palliative care, especially given our rapidly ageing population and the following are areas that we will continue to work on: First, support caregivers.  Caring for loved ones in their last days at home can be physically and emotionally draining. To reduce the risk of caregivers burn-out, MOH has since 2019 implemented a Home-Based Respite Care pilot to allow caregivers some rest while a trained caregiver steps in temporarily to care for their loved ones.  Feedback from the scheme has been promising, with close to 80% of caregivers indicating that they experienced a reduction in caregiving burden after using the service and based on this positive feedback, MOH is studying ways to extend the programme. 14 Second, expand palliative care capacity. MOH will ensure sufficient capacity to meet the growing demand for palliative care services. The number of day hospice places has increased steadily over the years as demand for care in the community grows, by over 60% since 2017, to about 160 places today. 15 In addition, MOH has launched the Inpatient Hospice Palliative Care Service in 2020.  Recognising that many patients have complex care needs towards end of life, the Palliative Care Service consolidates care services offered in community hospitals and inpatient hospices, into a single service type. This minimises the need to transfer the patients to different care facilities. Today, there are about 250 inpatient hospice places, in addition to the 160 day hospice places I mentioned earlier.  And we plan to have more of such beds in upcoming healthcare facilities over the next few years.16 We are also expanding the number of home palliative care places.  This will ensure that those who prefer to pass on at home would be able to do so. Patients would receive clinical, psychological, emotional and spiritual care during visits from the home palliative care team. The palliative care teams will also train caregivers in the family.  As of 2020, there are around 3,100 home palliative care places at any one time and MOH is building the capability to support more families and this is really the area that will move the needle.17 Third, raise palliative care capability. Healthcare, including palliative care, is highly dependent on competent and qualified workers.  This is why we have invested significantly in palliative care training for healthcare workers. The Graduate Diploma in Palliative Medicine that was launched to encourage doctors in community settings to be equipped with the relevant skills and knowledge to deliver good quality palliative care. To date, it has trained more than 100 doctors. 18 Further, the National Guidelines for Palliative Care set standards to steer the sector towards provision of good quality clinical and psychosocial care. The Lien Centre for Palliative Care, and the Palliative Care Centre for Excellence in Research and Education are the key partners in educating and training healthcare workers. Together with the Singapore Hospice Council, almost 11,000 healthcare workers have been trained to provide palliative care.  19 And finally, last thing we need to do, and the more importantly, we need to discuss the sensitive issue of deaths more openly and more honestly.  This is probably the most important thing we need to do. It has to happen within families, between patients and doctors, and amongst members of our society and healthcare fraternity.  It is one way to bridge the mismatch of expectations and desires I spoke out about earlier between a dying patient and his loved ones. 20 This is why more people are realising the value of Advance Care Planning over the years as a tool to document their healthcare preferences in the event they lose mental capacity to speak for themselves. In the last 10 years, Advance Care Planning has been on the increase, with over 27,000 lodged nationally. To encourage more of such honest conversations with family and healthcare staff, there have been various efforts to normalise death and dying as a topic. A local arts company, Both Sides Now, has used immersive arts experiences to reach a wide variety of audiences. The responses to its programme has been encouraging.  In the last run of the programme which ended in 2019, it engaged over 12,000 individuals and trained over 300 volunteers in Advanced Care Planning advocacy. 21 Since 2017, the Singapore Hospice Council has championed a “Live Well, Leave Well” public engagement campaign through TV commercials and social media. More student groups in tertiary institutions are also taking steps to raise awareness of end-of-life matters amongst their generation. One example is a project called Project Happy Apples by NUS medical school students.  22 What I have mentioned are just a handful of efforts, often ground up.  But I think there is an increase in awareness of end-of-life issues.  Family members must feel comfortable that putting their loved ones through palliative care fulfills the desire of the dying and is in fact an act of love.  It is a social attitude, which requires time to shift.  When it does, it will be for the better.    Conclusion23 The theme of today’s conference is “Embrace. Engage. Envision.” I hope it marks the start of a more honest conversation on end-of-life matters in our society.  By embracing the deeply personal concerns of patients and their loved ones, we can bridge the divide and recognise the importance of palliative care. We can then engage various stakeholders, in mobilising resources and building capabilities to develop the sector.   Then we can envision a future where we can bring dignity, solace and comfort to the great majority of the dying.  24 Last but not least, the Singapore Hospice Council celebrated its 25th anniversary earlier this year, 2021. I would like to thank the Singapore Hospice Council and all practitioners for the good work over the past two and a half decades.25 I wish everyone a fruitful conference.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-at-the-7th-singapore-palliative-care-conference,
SGP,Asia,Singapore,10/12/2021,272433,454,645.286,783,4,5.571,49954.709,83.248,118.323,Extension of Primary Series Vaccination to Children Aged 5 to 11 Years and Booster Vaccination to All Individuals Aged 18 to 29 Years,"        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has accepted the recommendation by the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) to use the paediatric doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 years. Vaccination for this group will commence before the end of this year, and once we receive deliveries of the vaccine doses. 1      From 14 December 2021, the Ministry of Health (MOH) will also extend the vaccination booster programme to individuals aged 18 to 29 years. HSA Approval of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty Vaccine for Children Aged 5 to 11 Years 2     On 10 December 2021, the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) approved the use of the paediatric doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 years. This will be the first COVID-19 vaccine HSA has granted approval for use in Singapore for this age group.3     The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination (EC19V) has also recommended its use for this age group. The EC19V has assessed that the benefits of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine outweigh the risks when used in a paediatric dosage for children aged 5 to 11 years, especially given ongoing community transmission and the emergence of the Omicron variant. The EC19V recommends that children with moderate to severe chronic medical conditions should be prioritised for access to the vaccine. 4     The recommended dosage of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine for children aged 5 to 11 years is one third of that used in persons aged 12 and above, i.e. two paediatric doses (10 micrograms each) that is spaced at least 21 days apart. 5     MOH has signed a new supply agreement with Pfizer-BioNTech for the COVID-19 vaccine and we expect the shipment to arrive before the end of December.  MOH will work with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) to roll out vaccinations for this school-going age group. We plan to start vaccinations before the end of this year.  Further details will be announced by MOE and ECDA shortly. Extending Booster Vaccination to Individuals Aged 18 to 296     While the primary series vaccinations provide excellent protection against severe disease, there is evidence of waning protection against infection over time, albeit at a slower pace in younger persons. Hence, the EC19V has assessed that booster vaccination is beneficial for protection against COVID-19 for persons aged 18 to 29 years. From 14 December 2021, we will extend the vaccination booster programme to individuals aged 18 to 29 years. All eligible persons will be able to receive their booster doses of the mRNA vaccine five months after completing their primary vaccination series.7     Eligible individuals will be invited to make an appointment for their booster dose. An SMS with a personalised booking link will be sent to their registered mobile number to book an appointment on www.vaccine.gov.sg. They may receive their booster dose at any Vaccination Centre or participating Public Health Preparedness Clinic. Collective Effort Towards COVID-19 Resiliency8     To date, 96% of eligible population and 87% of total population have completed their full regimen or received two doses of COVID-19 vaccines.  30% of total population have received their booster shots.9      While this is encouraging, we need more people to be vaccinated and boosted, especially given the emergence of the Omicron variant, which is likely to established itself all over the world in the coming couple of months. Vaccinations and boosters are the best protection against an unknown and highly transmissible COVID-19 variant. 10    MOH therefore encourages everyone who is eligible for boosters to take them as soon as possible, and not to wait. The two mRNA vaccines can be used interchangeably as boosters.  For those who are eligible to take boosters but have not received their SMS invitations, they are also invited to walk in to any Moderna Vaccination Centre to receive their booster vaccination without a need to book an appointment. MINISTRY OF HEALTH10 DECEMBER 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/extension-of-primary-series-vaccination-to-children-aged-5-to-11-years-and-booster-vaccination-to-all-individuals-aged-18-to-29-years,

At that time, a group of Chinese physicians in Singapore gathered to discuss the setup of an organisation to unify the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) community and improve the practice of TCM. While the objectives were simple, they had far-reaching implications for local development of TCM in the following decades. 3.     Over the past 75 years, SCPA has crossed significant milestones. In 1952 and 1953 respectively, SCPA established the Singapore Chung Hwa Medical Institution and Singapore College of TCM. In the 1960s and 70s, SCPA went on to set up what is now known as the Chung Hwa Medical and Drugs Research Institute and the Chung Hwa Acupuncture Research Institute. These institutions are now familiar household names, playing significant social and healthcare roles. 4.     75 years on, SCPA remains the largest TCM association in Singapore. TCM’s Role in Managing Chronic Illnesses 5.     While we face our biggest enemy COVID-19 today, the rise in incidence of chronic diseases will always be a constant healthcare challenge. 6.     When it comes to chronic diseases, all doctors, regardless whether you are a Chinese, Indian or Western doctor, know that prevention is better than cure. This means leading a healthy lifestyle, having a good diet, and staying happy and optimistic. 7.     This is not a new concept. More than 2,000 years ago, the “Emperor’s Canon of Internal Medicine” had already started to recommend the need for a balanced diet and work-life balance to maintain good health. With Yin and Yang balanced, it keeps illnesses at bay. 8.     Today, that is Ministry of Health’s (MOH) core policy. We have progressively strengthened healthcare resources in the primary and community care settings, and placed greater emphasis in promoting healthy living. The Health Promotion Board (HPB) is dedicated to do this. And I think, there is potential for TCM to play in the management of chronic conditions in our society. 9.     MOH will therefore continue to support the TCM sector, including for it to play a larger role in our healthcare sector.  One initiative is the $8 million TCM Research Grant in 2014, which aims to promote research collaborations between western doctors and TCM Practitioners. To date, 19 projects have been awarded. Such collaborations would allow western doctors to understand more about TCM, and TCM practitioners conduct more clinical research. 10.     MOH has also stepped up support for the professional development of the TCM sector, including through the $5 million TCM Development Grant launched in 2018. It supported over 50 TCM clinics in upgrading their clinics and IT facilities, eleven TCM conferences and forums, and TCM Continuing Professional Education course fees for many students. 11.     This month, we also appointed two workgroups, with representatives from the major TCM organisations, to explore how to further enhance clinical training for newly registered TCMPs, and a career and remuneration guideline for TCM practitioners. International Recognition of TCM 12.     We need to recognise that TCM is a complete set of medical knowledge and practice, with a history of several thousand years, and an important part of Chinese cultural heritage. 13.     I am glad to see its rising international recognition. Every few decades, the World Health Organization’s governing body, the World Health Assembly, will publish the organisation’s global compendium, known as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, or ICD. 14.     The ICD is a very significant global document. It categorises thousands of diseases, and affects how physicians make diagnoses, insurance companies determine coverage, epidemiologists ground their research and health officials interpret mortality statistics. 15.     The 11th revision of the ICD will come into effect on 1 Jan 2022. For the first time, the ICD will feature a classification system on traditional medicine, and will make TCM an integral part of global healthcare. 16.     Locally, SCPA can continue to promote TCM and its role in our national healthcare strategy. With the practice of Western medicine focusing more on preventive care, and Chinese medicine focusing more on education and research, I look forward to the two worlds gravitating closer towards each other, to provide better care for our people. Conclusion 17.     Finally, I would like to thank all TCM associations and practitioners for your continued support and cooperation in the fight against COVID-19 over the past two years.  As trusted healthcare providers to your patients, you have been able to persuade and encourage your patients, especially the elderly, to receive the COVID-19 vaccinations and booster. Every vaccination could be a life saved. 18.     We are now facing the unknown Omicron. We don’t know if Omicron will turn out to be a bigger enemy or savior, but Omicron is likely to spread globally, including Singapore, in the next few months, and establish itself in every society. I hope to continue to count on the support of the TCM community to overcome what challenges that may come our way. 19.     I wish you a fruitful Symposium.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-ong-ye-kung-minister-for-health-singapore-chinese-physicians'-association-75th-anniversary-celebration-opening-ceremony-of-2021-singapore-international-chinese-medicine-summit-symposium-12-december-2021,

SGP,Asia,Singapore,14/12/2021,274143,442,507.857,804,6,4.714,50268.263,81.047,93.123,Preparing for the Omicron Variant ,"    With the recent emergence of the Omicron variant globally, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) had introduced travel restrictions for affected countries/regions and subsequently enhanced our testing regime for travellers, including those arriving via the Vaccinated Travel Lanes (VTLs). These efforts have helped stem the flow of Omicron into Singapore, with 16 cases reported to date locally, and will buy us valuable time to better understand the variant and develop our responses. 2.  As more Omicron cases are reported globally, it is a matter of time before the Omicron variant surfaces within our community. With preliminary data suggesting that it is at least as transmissible as the Delta variant and may carry a higher risk of re-infection, there is a need for us to put in place additional measures to make sure we are prepared to deal with a spread of the Omicron variant in our community. 3.  To this end, we will have to press on more urgently with our booster vaccination programme to enhance protection against infection and severe disease, as preliminary data overseas shows that vaccinated individuals who had received a booster had significant protection against infection by the Omicron variant, and even if they were still infected, significant protection against developing severe disease which required hospital treatment. We will also extend Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) to more settings to better protect the vulnerable and at-risk groups in our population, while allowing specific concessions for fully vaccinated individuals to return safely to the workplace. In anticipation of a potential surge in local Omicron cases, we are also putting in place contingency plans to ramp up our ICU, hospital, and COVID-19 Treatment Facility (CTF) capacities. In addition, we will continue to promote regular testing at the workplace and in the community, to better facilitate early detection and rapid tracing and containment around Omicron cases. Update on Detected Omicron Cases and Assessment of Omicron Variant 4.  As of 14 December 2021, we have detected eight new confirmed Omicron cases, and six previously reported preliminary Omicron cases have also been confirmed by genomic sequencing[1]. This brings the total number of Omicron cases detected in Singapore to 16, with 14 imported cases and two local cases who were airport passenger service staff. All are fully vaccinated, with no or mild symptoms. 13 cases are recovering in isolation wards at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), and three cases have been discharged. Thus far, all cases have had minimal interactions in the community prior to being isolated, and we have not detected linked cases in the community. Active contact tracing is being conducted to ringfence close contacts of these cases and reduce onward transmission once infection with the Omicron variant is suspected, through the detection of S-gene target failure in their test results. This includes quarantine at designated facilities. The National Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) subsequently confirms infection with the Omicron variant through genomic sequencing of the test samples.5.  The Omicron variant has now been detected in over 60 countries, mainly in Africa and Europe. Current observations from affected countries/regions suggest that the Omicron variant is at least as transmissible as currently circulating variants. Global observations continue to suggest that most infections with the Omicron variant are either asymptomatic or with mild symptoms, although it is still unclear whether the Omicron variant causes overall less severe disease than other strains. In addition, preliminary real-world studies suggest some degree of immune evasion that could result in an increased risk of breakthrough infections amongst the recovered and vaccinated. Hence, boosters are required to increase one’s immunity and mitigate any effects of immune evasion. We will continue to monitor closely and evaluate the situation as more data emerges. Maximising Protection through Vaccination and Boosters6.  Vaccinations and boosters are the best protection against an unknown and likely highly transmissible COVID-19 variant like the Omicron variant. To support these efforts and encourage more people to get vaccinated and boosted, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced on 11 December 2021 that it will begin vaccination for children aged 5 to 11 years before the end of this year, using the paediatric doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 vaccine. We will also extend the booster programme to individuals aged 18 to 29 years, from 14 December 2021. All eligible persons will be able to receive their booster dose of the mRNA vaccine five months after completing their primary series vaccination regime.7.  Local and international data indicate that there is a lower risk of serious allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis from booster vaccination doses of mRNA vaccines. In view of this, we will streamline the process for administering booster vaccination doses of mRNA vaccines, by reducing the post-vaccination observation time from 30 minutes to 15 minutes. Updates to Community Safe Management Measures Reduction of Exemption Period for Recovered Persons to Enter Settings Where Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures Are Implemented 8.  From 1 January 2022, all recovered persons from COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated will only be given a 180-day exemption after infection[2] to enter settings where vaccination-differentiated safe management measures (VDS) are implemented. This is reduced from the current exemption period of 270 days, and calculated starting from the day of the first positive SAR-CoV-2 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test, obtained in Singapore. The adjustment is made due to concerns over the transmissibility and heightened reinfection risk of the Omicron variant, and quicker waning of protection acquired through past infections. These recovered persons who are not fully vaccinated should seek to complete their primary series vaccination regime promptly.9.  Non-fully vaccinated individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 infection prior to 1 January 2022 will also have their exemption period reduced from 270 days to 180 days. However, for individuals who will already exceed the 180-day period as at 1 January 2022, they will be granted an additional one month grace period till 31 January 2022 to complete their primary series vaccination regime, so as to continue being able to enter VDS settings. As recovered individuals need only one dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine or two doses of Sinovac[3] under the National Vaccination Programme to complete their primary series vaccination regime, they should do so latest by 17 January 2022, to allow an interval of 14 days from the completion of the regimen to be considered fully vaccinated. During the grace period from the date when they have exceeded the 180-day period, these individuals can produce their discharge memo for entry into VDS settings. Enhancements to Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS)10.  We had earlier announced that from 1 December 2021, we will expand VDS to more settings and activities, including in all Libraries under the National Library Board (NLB), and selected activities in community clubs/centres under People’s Association (PA). In addition, the concession for unvaccinated individuals to perform a pre-event test (PET) in lieu of being fully vaccinated would be removed with effect on 1 January 2022. We will expand these VDS settings further.11.  First, from 1 February 2022, we will expand VDS to cover all indoor sports facilities, Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), and leisure guests in hotels, hostels and serviced apartments. However, students in IHLs who are completing their full-time NITEC/Higher NITEC, Diploma or Degree programmes will be exempted from the VDS measures requirement when entering their respective educational institutions. More details will be released by the relevant agencies.12.  Second, from 1 February 2022, all events, irrespective of event size, must implement VDS in order to proceed. Currently, only events with over 50 attendees are required to implement VDS. However, even smaller-sized events can spark transmission that can then spread to wider groups of people, especially in view of the Omicron variant. That said, to minimise disruption to events which are already planned for, we will remove the existing concession only in end January 2022. Please see Annex A for the applicable settings.  13.  There are presently no plans to introduce VDS measures for children aged 12 years and below, as the focus now is to ensure our children are well protected by vaccination.14.  We had earlier announced on 8 November 2021 the roll-out of “VDS+Test” pilots in sports settings, selected mass sporting events, as well as selected MICE events,where we allowed some further easing of SMMs for fully vaccinated individuals with a valid negative Antigen Rapid Test (ART) result on-site prior to the activity. These pilots have been successful thus far, given strong compliance and enforcement on the ground, and we will continue to expand these pilots where feasible. Workplace Requirements15.  With the implementation of the Workforce Vaccination Measures[4] starting from 1 January 2022, we are in a better position to ease the current default work from home (WFH) posture, and will allow 50% of those who can WFH to return to the office.   16.  Currently, participants in work-related events are capped at 50 persons. We will raise this cap only for events where all participants remain masked and seated, at a safe distance from each other. All participants must also meet the VDS requirements. Social gatherings at the workplace will continue to be disallowed. More details will be provided separately.Preparatory Steps to Augment Healthcare Capacity and Revise Healthcare ProtocolsPlans to Ramp Up Healthcare Capacity17.  Given the likely higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant, a surge in local Omicron cases could risk straining our healthcare system once again. Hence, we are putting in place contingency plans to ramp up capacity in our public hospitals and ICU if necessary. To help manage the load in the public hospitals, we are also prepared to increase capacity in our CTFs, so as to facilitate direct admission or transfer of more stable COVID-19 patients from public hospitals to CTFs for continued monitoring if necessary. To complement these efforts, we are concurrently stepping up efforts to augment the manpower required in our hospitals and CTFs. Supporting Persons with Mild COVID-19 in the Community 18.  Majority of our COVID-19 cases have mild symptoms and can safely recover at home. This has been demonstrated for the Delta variant, and likely continues to be so for Omicron. To further right-site care arrangements for these individuals who do not require acute care in hospitals, MOH will work with our Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) to better support these individuals in their recovery and help them return to their normal lives as soon as possible. This would entail expanding the current Protocol 2[5] in January 2022 to cover mildly symptomatic and suitably fit COVID-19 patients who can recover well at home. More details will be released at a later date. Promoting Regular Testing and SurveillanceExtending Subsidies for Mandated Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) 19.  Testing remains key to our early detection and rapid tracing and containment of transmission, especially in light of the Omicron variant. We have thus far mandated an ART-based RRT regime for work settings at higher risk of COVID-19 exposure and spread[6]. With the emergence of the Omicron variant, our airport and other border frontline workers who are at heightened risk of exposure to the variant had recently reverted to a weekly PCR RRT as a precautionary measure. During this period as we step up our efforts to quickly detect and ringfence Omicron cases, all sectors will remain on their existing mandatory RRT regime, until more information is available on the Omicron variant.20.  The Government is currently subsidising companies on mandatory RRT until 31 December 2021. As we step up our efforts to detect and contain potential transmission of Omicron, we will provide continued support to employers by extending the subsidies for sectors on mandatory RRT until 31 March 2022. Beyond that, employers and businesses should be prepared to factor in testing costs as part of their normal business operations. Expanding our Network of Quick Test Centres21.  On top of mandating regular testing at high-risk work settings, we also encourage everyone, including fully vaccinated individuals, to exercise social responsibility and self-test regularly with ART kits, especially if you are participating in higher risk activities or attending large-scale events. Regular testing should become a way of life as we adapt to the evolving COVID-19 situation. This will be supported by a comprehensive network of testing infrastructure that is easily accessible islandwide.   22.  In line with this, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) has set up or partnered private providers to set up close to 60 Quick Test Centres (QTCs) where members of the public can make an appointment to conduct a self-administered ART under supervision by trained personnel. Each test is priced at $15, and can be used to fulfil workplace requirements under the RRT regime, for pre-event or pre-activity tests, or simply for anyone who wishes to get tested before attending a large-scale event. 23.  To augment our efforts in providing more accessible QTCs, we have partnered general practitioners (GPs), mall operators, and hotel groups to set up private QTCs (p-QTCs) in selected sites located conveniently across the island. With the strong support of our partners[7], we expect to have at least 60 additional p-QTCs set up within the next few weeks. We will continue to work closely with the industry to grow the network of p-QTCs and would like to encourage interested eligible providers to come onboard this effort. This will go a long way in fostering a culture of testing, which is important for early detection of cases and for keeping our communities safe. Strengthening our Collective Resilience against Omicron Variant24.  This set of measures serves as important safeguards to prepare ourselves for a potential surge of local Omicron cases, as we continue to evaluate the situation and ringfence around detected cases to slow, if not eliminate, any potential spread in the community during this period. We seek everyone’s continued effort and cooperation to exercise social responsibility and comply with all the measures that have been put in place. Test yourself regularly and follow the health protocols. Take up vaccination or boosters straightaway when these are offered to you, as they will likely protect you from severe disease. Only by doing so can we strengthen our collective resilience against the evolving COVID-19 situation.MINISTRY OF HEALTH 14 DECEMBER 2021[1] These are Cases 273611, 276363, 276223, 276794, 276796 and 276839. Separately, two other cases, 271487 and 271598 were previously reported as confirmed cases on 6 December 2021.[2] This exemption does not apply to entry into VDS+Test events or activities i.e. individuals will still have to do ART prior to these events. [3] For non-fully vaccinated recovered persons, it is recommended that you receive one dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (two doses if Sinovac under the National Vaccination Programme or Sinopharm under Special Access Route) at least 3 months after the date of diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.[4] Please refer to MOM’s Press Release on 23 October 2021: https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2021/1023-implementation-of-workforce-vaccination-measures[5] Protocol 2 refers to the management protocol for those who are well and test positive for COVID-19. Today, asymptomatic patients who test positive are to self-isolate at home for the next 72 hours. After 72 hours, they can re-test using an ART kit. If tested negative, they may exit isolation and resume normal activities. If they become unwell at any time, they should see a doctor.[6] Those currently on ART-based RRT includes: COVID-19 frontline workers, staff interacting with vulnerable population (e.g. healthcare/eldercare workers, children aged below 12 years old), those living in migrant worker dormitories, Construction, Marine and Process workers, staff in dine-in F&B establishments, personal care services, gyms and fitness studios, retail mall and supermarket staff, last-mile delivery workers (including parcel and food delivery personnel), public and private transport workers, and workers in essential services. Note: since 2 Dec 2021, border frontline workers have reverted to a weekly PCR RRT regime. [7] These include mall operators such as CapitaLand, Frasers Property Retail, hotels under the Far East Hospitality Group, Intercontinental Hotel Group, Accor Hotels, as well as Resorts World Sentosa. ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/preparing-for-the-omicron-variant_14Dec2021,

This supports the need for three doses of Sinovac-Coronavac vaccine as a primary series. Key Findings2.     The study period was from 1 October 2021 to 21 November 2021 and covered 1.25 million individuals. The persons in the study cohort were those aged 40 years and above, who received two doses of the vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme. The analysis accounted for differences in age, gender, race, housing type and the daily differences in infection rate.3.     Based on analysis of local data, the effectiveness of two doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine was 60% against severe disease, lower than that of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna mRNA vaccines which were 90% and 97% respectively.4.     These results support the need for three doses of Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccines as a primary series to attain better protection against severe disease, defined as requiring oxygen, intensive care unit (ICU) care and death due to COVID-19. Boosters Recommended for Maximum Protection5.     As persons who have received two doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine were observed to have lower protection against severe disease, they are recommended to receive a dose of a Pandemic Special Access Route-authorised mRNA vaccine as a third dose of their primary vaccination series. Otherwise, they should complete their primary series with a third dose of the Sinovac-CoronaVac. 6.     This recommendation is also substantiated by international findings. Based on preliminary data from Chile, persons who received the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine as the third dose after two doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine had a 95% reduction in the risks of infection. In contrast, the risk reduction in persons who received Sinovac-CoronaVac as the third dose was 71%. The antibody rise was also observed to be around 27 times higher when the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine was received as the third dose compared to if Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine was received.7.     All eligible persons will be able to receive their booster doses of the mRNA vaccine five months after completing their primary vaccination series. We will continue to monitor the vaccine effectiveness of the mRNA and non-mRNA vaccines, including how they are enhanced by a third dose or a booster dose. In the meantime, all persons who are eligible for their boosters should get boosted when it is offered to them.NATIONAL CENTRE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES MINISTRY OF HEALTH’S COVID-19 DATA MANAGEMENT AND ANALYTICS TEAM 15 DECEMBER 2021ANNEX",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/study-based-on-local-data-reaffirms-that-mrna-vaccines-offer-better-protection-against-covid-19,

I am very pleased to join all of you today to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Breastfeeding Mothers’ Support Group (BMSG) Singapore.Breastfeeding Efforts in Singapore2.  Breastfeeding is important to keep our babies healthy. It provides the essential energy and nutrients needed for optimal growth and development, as well as protection against infectious and chronic diseases. Especially relevant to current times,  the breastmilk of mothers vaccinated against COVID-19 can help protect their babies from COVID-19 due to antibodies against the virus it contains. Pregnant or breastfeeding mothers are therefore recommended to be vaccinated if not already so. In addition, mother's milk is more easily digested than formula milk. 3.  The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Health Promotion Board recommend all babies to be exclusively breastfed for the first six months and for up to two years or longer as long as both mother and baby are comfortable. Babies can continue with breast milk and be weaned at four to six months to a balanced diet. Breastfeeding boosts the mother-child relationship, prevents uterine bleeding after birth and helps the uterus return to its normal size. It also lowers the risk of diabetes, breast and ovarian cancers.4.  There are many upsides of breastfeeding. However, we also recognise that breastfeeding may sometimes be challenging and an emotional journey for mothers. It is important to provide support for mothers in the form of education, putting in place an enabling environment, and letting mothers know that they are not alone in this journey. In this aspect, I am encouraged by the strong commitment of BMSG and its key stakeholders in supporting breastfeeding.5.  A key stakeholder in perinatal nutrition and infant health is our hospitals. In 2017, the Ministry of Health called for all maternity hospitals, including private hospitals, to come on-board the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI). This initiative was launched by the WHO and UNICEF to provide a conducive environment for successful breastfeeding and optimal nutrition for babies from birth. I am pleased that  all public and five private maternity hospitals in Singapore are now BFHI-certified. The remaining two  private maternity hospitals are committed to being accredited. 6.  Beyond this,  BMSG also provides antenatal and postnatal breastfeeding education, as well as counselling across both physical and virtual platforms through a team of 40 trained counsellors. BMSG’s efforts will help to complement the Government’s work to raise awareness of breastfeeding, and provide appropriate emotional support and resources to breastfeeding mothers, as well as training for healthcare workers and caregivers.Looking beyond COVID-197.  Being a mother is no easy feat, especially amidst uncertain times like this. Even as we transit towards a COVID-19 resilient nation, challenges to our health, healthcare system and economy will remain. We can expect that the psychosocial impact of the pandemic will continue to be felt for some years to come, with knock-on effects on our mental health and wellbeing. I urge all to remain resilient and come together to support one another.8.  Thank you, and once again, happy 30th anniversary to BMSG!  ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/opening-remarks-by-parliamentary-secretary-for-ministry-of-health-and-ministry-of-communications-and-information-ms-rahayu-mahzam-at-the-30th-anniversary-celebrations-of-the-breastfeeding-mothers-support-group-(singapore)-on-18-december-2021,

All three cases are fully vaccinated and have mild symptoms. MOH is ringfencing the cases through contact tracing.Case 2808562.  Case 280856 is a 24 year-old male who is unemployed. He developed a sore throat and fever on 18 December 2021 and sought medical attention at a General Practitioner (GP) clinic where he underwent a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. His test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on the same day. Case 2809513.  Case 280951is an 18 year-old female who is a student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic, and was last in school on 15 December. She developed a sore throat and fever on 18 December and sought medical attention at a GP clinic where she was tested for COVID-19. Her PCR test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 19 December. Case 2809904.  Case 280990 is a 21 year old male who is a student at At-Sunrice Global Chef Academy but had not been to school recently. He developed a sore throat on 18 December and sought medical attention at a GP clinic where he was tested for COVID-19. His PCR test result came back positive for COVID-19 infection on 19 December.5.  All three cases had no recent travel history. Our epidemiological investigations found that they recently visited Anytime Fitness (Bukit Timah Shopping Centre) between 15 December and 17 December 2021.6.  Staff and visitors of Anytime Fitness (Bukit Timah Shopping Centre)who are identified to be close contacts of the cases will be placed on quarantine. As a precautionary measure, other visitors to the gym between 15 December and 17 December will be issued Health Risk Warnings (HRW). They will also be contacted by MOH for a one-time targeted PCR test. 7.  All visitors to the affected premises are advised to monitor their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as possible, for 14 days from their date of visit. They are encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.8.  To date, there are 71 confirmed Omicron cases detected in Singapore, with 65 imported cases and 6local cases. Given its high transmissibility and spread to many parts of the world, we should expect to find more Omicron cases at our borders and also within our community. It is important for everyone to continue to play their part and remain vigilant to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and to come forward to receive your vaccination or booster dose when offered. MINISTRY OF HEALTH20 DECEMBER 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/suspect-omicron-cluster-at-anytime-fitness-(bukit-timah-shopping-centre)_20Dec2021,

This will enable us to start vaccinations for children aged 5 to 11 years in end-December as planned. 2.             The Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty COVID-19 paediatric vaccine has met quality, safety and efficacy standards and has been approved by the Health Sciences Authority for use in children aged 5 to 11 years. The Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination has also recommended its use for this age group. 3.             The Ministry of Health is working with the Ministry of Education (MOE) and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) on details on the rollout of vaccination for this age group. Further operational details will be announced shortly by MOE and ECDA. 4.             Vaccinations and boosters are the best protection against COVID-19.

Thus far, our enhanced testing regime for travellers has helped us to detect 65 confirmed Omicron cases. With aggressive contact tracing and ringfencing measures, we have, for now, been able to limit onward community transmission. But it is a matter of time before the Omicron variant spreads in our community.3.     Our border measures will help to buy us time to study and understand the Omicron variant, and to strengthen our defences, including enhancing our healthcare capacity, and getting more people vaccinated and boosted.  4.     Meanwhile, we need everyone to remain vigilant to reduce the risks of widespread community transmission, and to keep yourself, your loved ones and the community safe.  In particular, travellers must adhere closely to the travel health control measures. Stricter enforcement for Travellers on Vaccinated Travel Lanes5.     We remind all VTL travellers1 that they must strictly adhere to the enhanced testing regime upon arrival in Singapore. VTL travellers are required to undergo an on-arrival test2  and test themselves daily using self-administered antigen rapid tests (ARTs). On Days 2, 4, 5 and 6, travellers are required to submit the results of their self-administered ART online using a link which will be sent to them via their declared contact details after arrival in Singapore. On Days 3 and 7, the tests must be done under supervision at a Combined Test Centre (CTC) or Quick Test Centre (QTC).3 Please refer to the Annex for an illustration of the testing regime.6.     Travellers must test negative on their self-administered ART before going out for activities on that day, except on Days 3 and 7 whereby travellers are to undergo their supervised test at a CTC or QTC before going about any other activities on that day. Travellers must take their ARTs and submit their self-administered ART results as necessary in a timely manner. Travellers who do not undergo the required tests and/or submit their results will be issued a Stay-Order/Stay-Home Notice (SHN), and will also face enforcement actions under the Infectious Diseases Act.7.     In view of the rise in Omicron cases globally, travellers should exercise personal responsibility, minimise their social interactions, and refrain from high-risk mask off activities (such as dining at F&B establishments, exercising in gyms or attending fitness classes), as well as avoid large gatherings and crowded places for 7 days from arrival, even if they have a negative daily ART result. Travellers who are unwell, including those showing early/mild symptoms should be socially responsible and seek medical attention immediately.Freezing of new VTL bookings8.     To limit our exposure to imported Omicron cases, we will impose limits on the number of VTL arrivals for the time being. We will freeze all new ticket sales for VTL flights and buses for travel into Singapore from 23 December 2021 to 20 January 2022, both dates inclusive. All travellers who already hold a ticket on a VTL flight or bus and meet all the other VTL requirements can continue to travel under the VTL. We will also temporarily reduce the VTL quotas and ticket sales for travel after 20 January 2022.  We will continue to monitor developments closely and update this policy as the situation changes.  9.     The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will provide further details for the VTL-Air, and the Ministry of Trade & Industry (MTI) for the VTL-Land. Remaining vigilant against the Omicron variant10.     We seek everyone’s continued effort and cooperation to exercise social responsibility and comply with all the measures that have been put in place.

There are currently about 29,000 individuals who are due for their third dose, after having received two doses of the Sinovac-CoronaVac. They are strongly recommended to receive a PSAR-authorised mRNA vaccine for their third dose unless medically ineligible to do so. 3.     This will help maintain the protection from the vaccine, as antibody levels from the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine declines rapidly within three to six months after completion of the second dose. Emerging international data indicates that while the mRNA vaccines, especially with booster vaccination, are protective against the Omicron variant, the Sinovac-CoronaVac and Sinopharm vaccines result in weaker neutralising activity and may not be protective. 4.     Taking the remaining dose of the three-dose primary regime will maintain the individual’s fully vaccinated status. Beyond this time interval, the individual’s vaccination status will revert to ‘additional dose needed’ and will be subject to the current Vaccination-Differentiated Safe Management Measures (VDS) if they do not do so. Walk-ins for Eligible Individuals to Complete Third Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine 5.     Individuals who have taken the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine as their first two doses can now walk into the following vaccination centres for their third dose to complete their primary series: a.    Vaccination centres offering the Moderna vaccine; b.    Vaccination centres offering the Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine, if they are aged 60 years and older; and c.     Raffles City Convention Centre (RCCC), which offers the Sinovac-CoronaVac vaccine, and takes walk-ins until 31 December 2021. Three Vaccination Centres to Offer both Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty and Moderna Vaccines 6.     From 27 December 2021, three Vaccination Centres – Bishan Community Club, Canberra Community Club, and Tanjong Pagar Community Club – will begin administering the Moderna vaccine, in addition to the currently available Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty vaccine. Individuals who have booked a slot for either vaccine brands at any of these Vaccination Centres via the National Appointment System are required to keep to their bookings and chosen vaccine type. 7.     In view of the rise in Omicron cases globally and locally, there is a need to be boosted for better protection. Those who have had their second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty or Moderna vaccine at least five months ago, but have not yet received their SMS notification can walk into any Vaccination Centre for a booster vaccination without the need for a prior appointment. MINISTRY OF HEALTH24 DECEMBER 2021",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/no-appointment-needed-for-persons-due-for-third-dose-of-sinovac-coronavac-vaccine,

All 10 cases are fully vaccinated and have mild or no symptoms. MOH is ringfencing the cases through contact tracing. 2.     The primary case in the cluster, Case 280860, is a traveller who arrived in Singapore on 14 December 2021 from the US via a Vaccinated Travel Lane (VTL) flight. His on-arrival test was negative for COVID-19, and he tested positive for COVID-19 infection on 18 December. 3.     On 15 December, Case 280860 met a colleague (Case 281477). Case 281477 subsequently visited The Vinyl Bar (266 River Valley Road) on 17 December. Our epidemiological investigations found that Case 281477 likely transmitted the virus to a staff of the bar (Case 281876) and three patrons (Cases 282091, 282143 and 282178) who were at the bar that evening. Case 282091 then went on to infect four household members. 4.     Staff and visitors of The Vinyl Bar (266 River Valley Road) who are identified to be close contacts of the cases will be placed on quarantine. As a precautionary measure, other staff and visitors to the bar at the same time as Case 281477 on 17 December will be contacted by MOH for a one-time targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. 5.     All visitors to The Vinyl Bar (266 River Valley Road) are advised to monitor their health closely, and minimise social interactions as far as possible, for 14 days from their date of visit. They are encouraged to see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell. 6.     We are picking up more Omicron cases because of the rapid spread of the variant across many countries/regions. To date, there are 448 confirmed Omicron cases detected in Singapore, with 369 imported cases and 79 local cases. Given its high transmissibility, it is a matter of time before the Omicron variant spreads in our community. It is important for everyone to continue to play their part and remain vigilant to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, and to come forward to receive your vaccination or booster dose when offered. MINISTRY OF HEALTH25 DECEMBER 2021 ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/omicron-cluster-at-the-vinyl-bar,

This strategy was effective in delaying the introduction of the variant into our community and slowing local spread. It bought us valuable time to learn about its nature and behaviour based on overseas and local data. 2.   International evidence indicates that the Omicron variant is likely to be more transmissible but less severe than the Delta variant, and that vaccines, especially boosters, retain substantial protection against hospitalisations caused by Omicron. In the last week, we had several unlinked Omicron cases as well as clusters in the community. This was not unexpected given the high transmissibility of the variant.  3.   Based on our updated understanding of the Omicron variant, we will adjust our approach to managing Omicron cases. From 27 December 2021, we will allow Omicron cases to follow Protocols 1-2-3 as with other COVID-19 cases. Omicron cases will be placed on the Home Recovery Programme or managed at community care facilities depending on their clinical presentation, instead of being isolated in dedicated facilities by default. Close contacts of Omicron cases will be placed on Protocol 3 where they will be issued a 7-day Health Risk Warning instead of being quarantined for 10 days. Those currently in quarantine will be progressively discharged over the next few days.4.   To bolster our protection against a large wave of cases locally and to keep our workplaces safe, from 15 January 2022, we will remove the pre-event testing (PET) concession for unvaccinated persons to go to work under the Workforce Vaccination Measures. We will also open applications for a second round of free antigen rapid test (ART) kit distribution for workplaces not on mandatory rostered routine testing (RRT) to implement voluntary weekly testing for two months. This will facilitate early identification of cases and reduce workplace transmission as more return to their workplaces. From 1 February 2022, we will also make vaccination a condition for the approval of new applications for and renewal of existing long-term passes, work passes, as well as permanent residences.5.   Lastly, with the increasing global spread of Omicron, the travel restrictions we had instituted earlier will need to be updated. In particular we will end the travel restrictions on Bostwana, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zimbabwe from 26 December  2021, 2359 hours. All passengers with 14-day travel history to the countries listed above will be allowed to enter and transit through Singapore and will be subjected to border measures for Category IV countries/regions.  Updates on Detected Omicron Cases and Assessment of Omicron Variant 6.   As of 25 December 2021, we have detected 546 confirmed Omicron cases comprising 443 imported cases and 103 local cases. In the last week, we have had 13 unlinked community Omicron cases and 78 Omicron cases from local linked community transmission.7.   The Omicron variant has now been detected in over 110 countries, mainly in Africa and Europe. Current observations from affected countries/regions suggest that the Omicron variant is more transmissible than currently circulating variants. Globally, the Omicron variant has overtaken the Delta variant as the predominant variant in numerous countries, such as the United Kingdom and Denmark.  8.   Available data thus far suggests that Omicron infections face reduced risks of hospitalisation and severe disease compared to Delta infections. Locally, our Omicron cases have so far not been severe as well – none has required intensive care or oxygen supplementation, although this may be partially due to most cases being fully vaccinated and from younger age groups. Preliminary estimates from overseas studies also indicate that two doses of mRNA vaccines reduce the risk of symptomatic infection from Omicron by about 35%. The risk is further reduced to about 75% lower for individuals with a primary and booster mRNA regimen. These statistics refer to protection against symptomatic infection. There should be better protection against severe infection and death due to cellular immunity and other factors. It is therefore important for us to press on with our booster vaccination programme to enhance protection against infection and severe disease.Adjusting Our Approach for Managing Local Omicron Cases9.   Based on our updated understanding and international experience with the Omicron variant, we expect more cases of Omicron infections than for Delta but proportionately fewer severe cases or deaths, due to the lower severity of the Omicron variant and protection from vaccinations and boosters. 10.   We will therefore shift our approach for managing Omicron cases to the prevailing Protocols 1-2-3 from 27 December 2021. Omicron cases will no longer need to be isolated in dedicated facilities by default. As per Protocol 1, unwell cases will be processed based on both their clinical presentation and underlying risk factors and either be placed under the Home Recovery Programme or managed at COVID-19 treatment facilities or  hospitals. They would follow a time-based discharge of 10 days (for vaccinated persons or children less than 12 years old) or 14 days (unvaccinated persons). Persons who are well but test positive will continue to self-test and self-manage under Protocol 2, including using ART tests to discharge from the third day onwards.11.   Close contacts of Omicron cases will be placed on Protocol 3 instead of being quarantined at dedicated facilities for 10 days. They will be issued a 7-day Health Risk Warning and be required to self-test with ART daily before leaving their homes. Contact tracing efforts would shift back towards self-reporting by family members and leveraging digital tools such as TraceTogether, and tight ringfencing of vulnerable settings such as hospitals, nursing homes, MSF elderly homes and preschools.12.   The adjustments in our approach for managing local Omicron cases will allow us to focus our healthcare resources on severe cases and protecting the vulnerable settings. It also allows us to go back to having a single streamlined approach to manage COVID-19, regardless of COVID-19 viral strains, which will facilitate operations on the ground and compliance to the protocols. Removal of PET Concession under the Workforce Vaccination Measures13.   We had earlier announced that Workforce Vaccination Measures would be implemented starting from 1 January 2022[1] and also indicated that we would be reviewing the concession for unvaccinated employees to go back to the workplace with a negative Pre-Event Testing (PET) result.  14.   Following the review and discussion with tripartite partners, we have decided to remove the PET concession for unvaccinated persons to return to the workplace from 15 January 2022. Partially vaccinated workers (i.e. those who have taken at least one dose of vaccine but are not yet fully vaccinated) will be granted a grace period until 31 January 2022 to complete their vaccination regime. During the grace period, they will continue to be able to enter the workplace with a negative PET result. 15.   This change will help to protect unvaccinated individuals and to create safer workplaces for everyone.The tripartite partners support the move and have issued an updated advisory on COVID-19 vaccination at the workplace, to provide guidance to employers and employees (www.mom.gov.sg/vaccinationadvisory).Promoting Regular Self-Testing with Voluntary Distribution of ART Kits to Workplaces 16.   As more employees return to their workplace from 1 January 2022, this may result in higher risk of workplace transmission, particularly given the higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant. While our workforce is highly vaccinated and hence protected from severe disease, we encourage all firms to implement regular testing for all employees. This will help to detect possible COVID-19 infection early and allow individuals who test positive to take precautions to self-isolate and protect their family, friends and colleagues. Higher risk workplaces are already on mandatory FET RRT and we have extended funding support for vaccinated individuals on RRT until 31 March 2022.17.   To support lower-risk workplaces in implementing regular testing, we will conduct a second round of voluntary distribution of ART kits for workplaces. Firms with employees that work onsite and are not already subject to mandatory RRT may apply for 8 ART kits per onsite vaccinated employee for weekly testing over a two-month period, if they require the funding support[2]. Applications will open from 3 to 31 January 2022. More details will be made available at www.go.gov.sg/time-limited-rrt-art closer to date. Vaccination as a Condition for New Applications for and Renewal of Long-Term Passes, Work Passes and Permanent Residence18.   To sustain our high vaccination rates, we had earlier introduced the requirement for long-term pass holders to be vaccinated as an entry requirement to Singapore. This has been in place since 1 November 2021. From 1 February 2022, COVID-19 vaccination will be a condition for the approval or grant of new long-term passes, work passes, as well as permanent residence. Vaccination will also be required when renewing existing work passes. More details on the vaccination condition can be found in Annex A.Resumption of Travel from Botswana, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zimbabwe19.   We had previously announced that long-term pass holders and short-term visitors with recent travel history to Botswana, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zimbabwe within the last 14 days will not be allowed entry into Singapore or transit through Singapore for a period of four weeks following initial reports on Omicron cases in these countries/regions. 20.   The Omicron variant has since spread widely around the world. We will therefore lift the travel ban for these countries, and place them under the Category IV classification.  This means that all passengers with 14-day travel history to Botswana, Eswatini, Ghana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, and Zimbabwe prior to departure to Singapore will be allowed to enter and transit through Singapore from 26 December 2021, 2359 hours, and will be subjected to border measures for Category IV countries/regions. 21.   The country/region classification and its corresponding border measures may be found in Annex B. As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID resilient nation. The full list of Safe Travel Lanes for travel to Singapore and prevailing border measures under each lane for different categories and changes to border measures will be updated on the SafeTravel website. Not all lanes may utilise the Category I/II/III/IV health measure framework. Travellers are advised to visit the website to check the latest border measures for their country/region which will apply upon entry into Singapore and be prepared to be subjected to the prevailing border measures upon entry.Shift Towards Living with Omicron Variant22.   The adjustments to our measures aim to strike a balance between slowing the spread of COVID-19 and continuing with our plan to live with COVID-19. With the higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant, we must expect a new wave of local cases soon. However, the peak of the wave can be blunted and we can avoid overwhelming our healthcare system again if everyone plays their part to get their vaccinations and booster doses, self-test regularly and self-isolate if tested positive. Those who have recently arrived from overseas or been in contact with an infected person should also be socially responsible and reduce their social interactions. 23.   With better understanding of Omicron, we also intend to take the next step towards living with COVID-19 by partnering our community GPs in caring for the majority of suitably fit individuals with mild symptoms under an expanded Protocol 2. More details on this expanded Protocol 2 will be released in early January 2022. We seek Singaporeans’ continued support to see us through this next challenge in our fight against COVID-19. 24.   Given the transmissibility of Omicron and the open nature of our society, it is inevitable that Omicron will spread in our community, as it has in over 100 countries already.  In the coming days and weeks, we should expect more community cases, and rapid doubling of cases. This is again a process we need to go through, in order to live with COVID-19. We have done whatever we can to prepare ourselves for it; especially in administering boosters to our population and starting vaccinations for our children. We seek the cooperation and understanding of everyone, as we weather through an Omicron wave in the next one to two months.MINISTRY OF HEALTH 26 DECEMBER 2021[1] Please refer to MOM’s Press Release on 23 October 2021: https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2021/1023-implementation-of-workforce-vaccination-measures  [2] The unvaccinated would have to pay for their own PET from 1 January 2022 before returning to the workplace and from 15 January 2022 they will not be allowed to return to office at all. Similarly, partially vaccinated individuals would also have to pay for their own PET tests until such time they are fully vaccinated.  ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/adjusting-our-approach-to-manage-the-omicron-variant_26Dec2021,

As of 30 December 2021, we have detected 912 Omicron imported cases; of whom 685 were detected through our enhanced testing regime for VTL travellers. 2.     We previously announced that all VTL travellers [1] must undergo COVID-19 tests up till Day 7 of their arrival and strictly adhere to this enhanced testing regime (please see Annex for testing regime) for four weeks in the first instance (until 2 January 2022). The enhancement has proven effective in detecting imported Omicron cases amongst VTL travellers and reducing onward transmission. As such, we will be extending the enhanced testing regime for an additional four weeks and will review it as the situation evolves. 3.     We had earlier also required all non-VTL travellers entering Singapore to undergo on-arrival tests (OAT). This was to pick up the Omicron cases early, as the variant was new, and we wanted to learn more about it. As we have gathered more information on the Omicron variant, we have further assessed that OATs for non-VTL travellers, who are all required to serve a 7 or 10 day Stay Home Notice (SHN) either at their place of residence or at a dedicated facility, are no longer required. In addition, these travellers will also be required to undergo a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test at the end of their SHN, and have to test negative before they are allowed to exit SHN, further reducing the risk of onward transmission. Hence, from 7 January 2022, 2359 hours (Singapore time), all non-VTL travellers entering Singapore from Category II (non-VTL), III and IV countries will no longer be required to undergo a COVID-19 PCR test on-arrival. Regular Review of Border Measures 4.     As the global situation evolves, we will continue to adjust our border measures in tandem with our roadmap to becoming a COVID resilient nation.
