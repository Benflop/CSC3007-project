Many of the religious leaders shared at the meeting that they have already put in place several measures to protect their worshippers.4.            The Ministers highlighted the role of social responsibility in reducing the risk of transmission. Those who are unwell, including worshippers, volunteers and staff, should consult a doctor immediately and avoid going to religious events or places of worship. This includes having mild symptoms such as cough, sore throat and runny nose, as not all cases of COVID-19 infection had a fever at onset of symptoms. 5.            MOH shared additional measures that can be adopted, including reminding worshippers not to attend religious events if they have recent travel history to mainland China in the last 14 days, or are under leave of absence, increasing the frequency of cleaning of commonly used areas, and minimising sharing of common items where possible. There should also be good ventilation at venues where large events are held.6.            The most effective method to prevent transmission remains through good personal hygiene of regular hand washing with soap and water, and to avoid touching our face unnecessarily.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/meeting-with-religious-leaders-on-covid-19

Hu arrived in Singapore on 22 January 2020 and was confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 on 31 January. Shi had been identified as a close contact of Hu and was issued a Quarantine Order on 1 February. Hu has since fully recovered from the infection and had been discharged from hospital on 19 February.3.            Once a COVID-19 case is confirmed, MOH initiates contact tracing to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the case while he/she was symptomatic. Close contacts are monitored closely and may be quarantined, so that they can be identified and treated early if they develop the disease. This measure also prevents close contacts from mingling in the community if they become symptomatic, and helps to contain further transmission of COVID-19. 4.          Both Hu and Shi had given false information to MOH officials about their movements and whereabouts from 22 January to 29 January when they were contacted for the purposes of contact tracing. Shi had also provided false information while under quarantine. However MOH was able to establish their true movements through detailed investigations.5.            In view of the potentially serious repercussions of the false information given by the defendants, and the risk they could have posed to public health, MOH has served Hu and Shi charges on 25 February. The case will be heard in Court on 28 February.6.            Any person convicted of an offence under the Infectious Diseases Act is liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both, for the first offence. 7.             MOH reminds the public that under the Infectious Diseases Act, it is an offence under the law for anyone to withhold or provide inaccurate information to MOH officials during contact tracing. MOH views such actions seriously and will not hesitate to take appropriate action against the perpetrators.  ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/two-charged-under-infectious-diseases-act-for-false-information-and-obstruction-of-contact-tracing

SGP,Asia,Singapore,3/3/2020,110,2,2.714,0,0,0,20.17,0.367,0.498,Additional Precautionary Measures In Response to Escalating Global Situation ,"In view of the surge in the number of confirmed cases around the world – in particular in Iran, northern Italy[1], Japan and Republic of Korea – the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will put in place further precautionary measures to limit the risk that these affected regions may pose to Singapore.2.            As of 3 March 2020, 12pm, there were 90,689 confirmed cases of COVID-19 globally, including 10,538 cases outside mainland China. The Republic of Korea has reported 4,812 cases, an increase of 600 cases in the last day. There were 1,835 cases reported in Italy, mostly in its northern region. Iran has reported 1,501 cases, an increase of 523 cases in the last day, and Japan has confirmed 268 cases. 3.            The Taskforce is monitoring the situation closely. It will continue to take a calibrated and risk-based approach in determining the appropriate precautions and measures for Singapore. In the days ahead, it is likely that we will see a surge of infected cases in countries around the world, including in America, Europe, the Middle East and the rest of Asia. Singapore is a small, globally-connected city-state, and we are faced with a higher risk of imported cases. Additional precautions for outgoing and incoming travellers4.            To protect Singaporeans, the Taskforce will put in place additional precautions for outgoing and incoming travelers.5.            In particular, Singaporeans are advised to defer non-essential travel to Iran, northern Italy, Japan and the Republic of Korea. Singaporeans should note that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ advisory issued on 8 January 2020 against travelling to or remaining in Iran due to rising tensions in the Middle East remains in place.6.            As the situation will continue to evolve, Singapore residents who need to travel to the affected regions are advised to regularly check the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) website for updates. Travellers are also advised to stay vigilant, monitor developments and heed the advice of the local authorities while overseas.7.            From 4 March 2020, 2359 hours, all new visitors with recent travel history to Iran, northern Italy or the Republic of Korea within the last 14 days will not be allowed entry into Singapore, or transit through Singapore. With immediate effect, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) will suspend the issuance of all forms of new visas to those with Iranian passports[2]. Previously issued short-term and multiple-visit visas for those with Iranian passports will also be suspended. During this period of suspension, they will not be allowed entry into Singapore. 8.            From 4 March 2020, 2359 hours, the following returning groups will be issued with a Stay-Home Notice (SHN):a)            Residents (Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) with recent travel history to Iran, northern Italy, or the Republic of Korea within the last 14 days; andb)            Long-term pass holders (including work passes, Student’s Pass, Dependant’s Pass and Long-term Visit Pass) with recent travel history to Iran, northern Italy or the Republic of Korea within the last 14 days. Under the SHN, they will have to remain in their place of residence at all times for a 14-day period after returning to Singapore.Expanded clinical case definition9.            MOH has expanded the definition of suspect cases to include persons with pneumonia or severe respiratory infection with breathlessness who had been to Iran, northern Italy, Japan and the Republic of Korea within 14 days before onset of symptoms. Cases meeting the expanded definition will be referred to hospitals for further assessment.Precautionary testing for symptomatic travellers10.          From 4 March 2020, 2359 hours, travellers entering Singapore and exhibiting fever and/or other symptoms of respiratory illness but who do not meet the clinical suspect case definition may be required to undergo a COVID-19 swab test at the checkpoint.[3] They may carry on with their journey immediately after undergoing the test. Pending the results, which may take between three and six hours, the travellers are advised to minimise contact with others as a precautionary measure. Individuals will be contacted on their swab test results and those with positive results will be conveyed to the hospital in a dedicated ambulance.11.          Short-term visitors who are identified for testing but refuse to do so will not be allowed entry into Singapore. Singapore Permanent Residents and long-term pass holders who refuse testing may have their immigration facilities and work pass privileges revoked or the validity shortened. All travellers, including Singapore Citizens, who do not comply with the testing or who cannot be contacted subsequently may face penalties and can be prosecuted under the Infectious Diseases Act.12.          The COVID-19 swab test kit deployed at checkpoints allows us to test beyond persons who are referred to hospitals, and extend testing to lower-risk symptomatic travellers as an added precautionary measure. This additional testing capability deployed upfront at checkpoints further increases our likelihood of detecting imported cases at the point of entry. As with any test, a negative result does not completely rule out the possibility of infection. As such, symptomatic travellers with a negative test result should continue to minimise social contact and seek medical attention should symptoms not improve over the next three days.     Preparing ahead13.          The additional precautions we are taking will help to reduce the risk of imported cases in Singapore. But the virus is spreading quickly around the world, and there are likely to be many undetected cases in countries that are not undertaking proactive testing.  So we will be exposed to new waves of infection, and increasingly it will not be possible to stop the virus at our borders. We also cannot isolate Singapore and shut ourselves from the world. So despite our best efforts, we have to be prepared for new spikes in COVID-19 cases in Singapore, as has happened elsewhere. 14.          We will therefore have to redouble our efforts within Singapore. All of us have a role to play. The Government will continue to put in resources to detect and isolate all cases of infection, as well as identify and quarantine their close contacts so as to break the chain of infection. Individuals will need to continue with practices that have proven effective in reducing the spread of infectious diseases. These include:•             Staying home when unwell and during the period covered by medical certificates;•             Practising good personal hygiene such as washing hands regularly with soap and water, and not touching the face unnecessarily; and•             Cleaning up after oneself at hawker centres and not sharing utensils.These need to become part of our daily life permanently. Such habits will enable us to resist infections like COVID-19, while going about our daily lives normally as much as possible.[1]   Refers to eight administrative regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol.[2]   Travellers from Italy and the Republic of Korea do not require visas to visit Singapore.[3]  Travellers who meet the clinical suspect case definition will be conveyed directly to the hospital.MINISTRY OF HEALTH3 MARCH 2020",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/additional-precautionary-measures-in-response-to-escalating-global-situation

Once identified, MOH will closely monitor all close contacts. As a precautionary measure, they will be quarantined for 14 days from their last exposure to the patient. In addition, all other identified contacts who have a low risk of being infected will be under active surveillance, and will be contacted daily to monitor their health status.43.       As of 8 March 2020, 12pm, MOH has identified 3,649 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 615 are currently quarantined, and 3,034 have completed their quarantine.Health advisory44.       Singaporeans are advised to defer all travel to Hubei Province and all non-essential travel to mainland China, Iran, northern Italy, Japan and the Republic of Korea.45.       All travellers should monitor their health closely for two weeks upon return to Singapore and seek medical attention promptly if they feel unwell. Travellers should inform their doctor of their travel history. If they have a fever or respiratory symptoms (e.g. cough, shortness of breath), they should wear a mask and call the clinic ahead of the visit.46.       Travellers and members of the public should adopt the following precautions at all times: Avoid close contact with people who are unwell or showing symptoms of illness; Observe good personal hygiene; Practise frequent hand washing with soap (e.g. before handling food or eating, after going to toilet, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretions after coughing or sneezing); Wear a mask if you have respiratory symptoms such as a cough or shortness of breath; Cover your mouth with a tissue paper when coughing or sneezing, and dispose the soiled tissue paper in the rubbish bin immediately; and Seek medical attention promptly if you are feeling unwell.  47.       MOH will continue to monitor the situation closely. As medical practitioners are on the lookout for suspect cases, Singapore is likely to see more cases that will need to be investigated.     [1] Case 132 is likely to be an imported case involving a 37 year-old female Singapore Permanent Resident who had been in London from 23 February to 27 February. She was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 6 March.  ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/twelve-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-confirmed

Like all other cruise ships departing from Singapore’s cruise terminals, Costa Fortuna was disinfected prior to its departure from Singapore. All its passengers also completed pre-embarkation checks based on prevailing policies for travel history and temperature screening as required by the cruise line and the terminal operator prior to boarding. This is its 16th call since December 2019. 4.        Costa Fortuna has not picked up any new passengers since it left Singapore on 3 March 2020[1] . 5.        After Costa Fortuna berths, doctors, licensed by the Ministry of Health, will conduct enhanced, one-on-one checks on passengers who have recent travel history to northern Italy within the last 14 days. Those who exhibit fever and/or other symptoms of respiratory illness will be conveyed directly to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases. Those without symptoms will be conveyed directly to the airport for their onward flights. 6.        All remaining passengers entering Singapore will also undergo temperature screening as a precautionary measure. Those who exhibit fever and/or other symptoms of respiratory illness will be required to undergo a COVID-19 swab test. Passengers who are identified for COVID-19 swab testing but refuse to do so will not be allowed entry into Singapore. ______[1] From 4 March 2020, 2359 hours, all new visitors with recent travel history to Iran, northern Italy or the Republic of Korea within the last 14 days will not be allowed entry into Singapore, or transit through Singapore. Issued by: Ministry of Health Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore Singapore Tourism Board ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/joint-statement-by-moh-mpa-and-stb-precautionary-measures-taken-for-cruise-ship-s-scheduled-call-at-singapore
SGP,Asia,Singapore,10/3/2020,160,10,7.143,0,0,0,29.338,1.834,1.31,Additional Precautionary Measures to Protect Our Seniors,"Additional precautionary measures will be put in place to reduce the risk of further transmission of COVID-19 among seniors.2.            The Ministry of Health (MOH) has studied the pattern of transmission among recent confirmed cases. It has found that many of the cases were transmitted during social activities and gatherings among seniors. For example, many of the confirmed cases over the weekend were linked to the SAFRA Jurong cluster and other social activities. These are mainly seniors who took part in singing classes and other activities such as qigong and line-dancing at several community clubs (CCs) and residents’ committees (RCs). They are active agers who participate often in such group activities, joining multiple groups across different venues in Singapore.3.            While we encourage seniors to be active, there is now evidence of COVID-19 transmission among the seniors participating in such social activities, chiefly because some individuals who were unwell had continued to participate in them.4.            The Ministry of Health (MOH) had on 7 March announced precautionary measures for these groups of seniors. It had called for a 14-day suspension of all activities and classes in CCs and RCs which the confirmed cases had participated in, as well as all singing classes organised by the People’s Association (PA) at the affected CCs and RCs. Suspension of senior-centric activities for 14 days5.            Seniors are a particularly vulnerable group. We will therefore introduce additional targeted social distancing measures for our seniors. All senior-centric activities conducted by government agencies will be suspended for 14 days from 11 March to 24 March 2020. These include activities held at CCs, RCs, Senior Activity Centres, Active Ageing Hubs, CREST centres, Health Promotion Board and ActiveSG sport centres.16.            In the interim, organisers will implement additional precautionary measures before activities resume. These include reducing the group size of activities to prevent crowding, re-organising activities to minimise physical contact, increasing the frequency of sanitising equipment between activities, providing sufficient facilities for regular hand washing, and checking if participants are well.7.            Care services for seniors – such as nursing homes, inpatient and day hospices, senior care centre services and home-based care services – will continue to run, but with additional precautionary measures.8.            Seniors who feel unwell should see a doctor and stay at home. Those who are well can continue to go to work, and go about their daily routine such as marketing and individual exercise in the meantime. But they should continue to take precautionary measures to keep themselves safe, such as maintaining good personal hygiene, washing their hands frequently and avoiding touching their face and eyes.9.            The Multi-Ministry Taskforce is assessing the situation locally as well as globally, and is studying a broader range of social distancing measures we might take to help further slow down the spread of the virus. Social responsibility is key10.          Social responsibility is a critical factor in slowing the transmission of the virus. Many of the locally transmitted cases were the result of the socially irresponsible actions of a few individuals who attended events and activities despite being unwell.11.          About 35 of the 160 confirmed cases thus far had not minimised social contact although they had already developed fever or respiratory symptoms, or consulted a doctor early when unwell. More than a fifth (22%) of the confirmed cases continued to work or carried on with their daily routine despite being sick. For instance:a)            The cluster at Wizlearn Technologies Pte Ltd had 14 confirmed cases. Of these, nine were staff, and three of them had continued with their daily activities despite feeling unwell. One staff also spread the virus to a family contact, who also had carried on with daily activities while symptomatic. This in turn resulted in an additional four cases who had not worked at the company.b)            Of the cases linked to the private dinner function at SAFRA Jurong, one case who was already unwell had attended the function on 15 February, and subsequently tested positive. This could have resulted in 18 additional cases who were also at the dinner and subsequently tested positive. 10 of these 18 cases continued with daily activities despite feeling unwell, resulting in an additional 17 positive cases who had not been at the dinner.12.          We also urge the public to refrain from doctor-hopping so that the same doctor can follow up with each case, and make the appropriate assessment if a case needs to be tested for COVID-19. Of the confirmed cases, 38 (24%) had visited more than one general practitioner (GP) clinic. Among these 38 patients, eight had visited three or more GP clinics.13.          Our ability to carry out effective contact tracing requires the cooperation of individuals to provide comprehensive and truthful accounts about their activities when they are interviewed by MOH’s public health officers. Otherwise our ability to quickly get in contact with others who may have been infected and to ring-fence clusters will be delayed.14.          Socially irresponsible behaviour poses a risk to all. The measures we have implemented will not work if individuals do not cooperate, and continue to engage in socially irresponsible behaviour. We urge all Singaporeans to play their part in the fight against the virus. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should see a doctor and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others. MINISTRY OF HEALTH10 MARCH 20201 The list of activities which are suspended is in the Annex, and can be found on PA’s and MyActiveSG’s websites, as well as the Health Promotion Board’s HealthHub portal or Healthy 365 mobile app.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/additional-precautionary-measures-to-protect-our-seniors

SGP,Asia,Singapore,13/3/2020,200,22,10,0,0,0,36.673,4.034,1.834,Additional Precautionary Measures to Prevent Further Importation and Spread of Covid-19 Cases,"            Singapore will implement additional precautionary measures to slow the transmission of the COVID-19 virus. These include travel advisories against all non-essential travel and border restrictions for Italy, France, Spain and Germany, as well as additional social distancing measures within Singapore.2.            The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, and called upon governments around the world to do more to combat the virus. The WHO cited Singapore as a country that has already taken proactive measures to contain the virus. Still, as the co-chairs of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce said on Tuesday, and as the Prime Minister warned in a national broadcast yesterday, we must take additional measures, including further temporary travel restrictions, to break the transmission of the virus.3.            In the past two weeks, the number of cases of COVID-19 outside China has increased more than ten-fold, and the number of affected countries has tripled. There are now more than 125,000 cases in 118 countries, and more than 4,000 deaths. In Singapore, as of 12 March, almost 25% of our total number of confirmed cases were imported. Over the past ten days alone, there have been 23 imported cases, or nearly a third of all new cases. These included 13 cases with travel history to European countries, and six cases from Indonesia. Travel advisory4.            In light of the rapid spread of the virus across Europe, the Ministry of Health (MOH) advises Singaporeans to defer all non-essential travel to Italy, France, Spain and Germany. The four countries have had very high numbers of cases and very high rates of increase. In addition, our existing advisory to defer all travel to Hubei province in mainland China, and non-essential travel to the rest of mainland China, Iran1, Japan and the Republic of Korea, remains.5.            Singaporeans are also advised to exercise caution when travelling to all countries affected by COVID-19, especially those which have exported cases (see Annex). These include our neighbouring countries, like Indonesia and the Philippines, and those further afield, like the United Kingdom. The global picture is evolving, and there could be other countries that may be affected.6.            Singaporeans who have made plans to travel during the upcoming March school holidays are advised to review their plans based on the latest advisory. All travellers will be subject to the prevailing travel measures imposed by their destination countries, and those imposed by Singapore upon their return home. As Singapore’s measures will evolve according to the global situation, Singaporeans should check the MOH website (https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19) for the latest measures. Border restrictions7.            Given the increase in imported cases from European countries, we are putting in place new border restrictions.a.            From 15 March 2020, 2359 hours, all new visitors with recent travel history to Italy, France, Spain and Germany within the last 14 days will not be allowed entry into Singapore, or transit through Singapore. b.            From 15 March 2020, 2359 hours, the following returning groups will be issued with a Stay-Home Notice (SHN):i.              Residents (Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents) with recent travel history to Italy, France, Spain and Germany within the last 14 days; andii.             Long-term pass holders (including work passes, Student’s Pass, Dependant’s Pass, and Long-term Visit Pass) with recent travel history to Italy, France, Spain and Germany within the last 14 days. 8.            Persons under SHN will have to remain in their place of residence at all times for 14 days after returning to Singapore.9.            As previously announced, residents and long-term pass holders returning from mainland China (outside Hubei province2), Iran, and the Republic of Korea will continue to be issued a 14-day SHN upon return to Singapore.10.          All these border restrictions are temporary, and will be reviewed regularly based on the global situation. Additional precautionary measures11.          Since 4 March 2020, travellers entering Singapore and exhibiting fever and/or other symptoms of respiratory illness are required to undergo a COVID-19 swab test at the checkpoint, regardless of travel history. With immediate effect, all such travellers will also be issued a 14-day SHN3, which they will have to serve in full even if the result of the swab test is negative. Those who meet the clinical suspect case definition will be conveyed to the hospital for follow-up.12.          With immediate effect, Singapore will cease port calls for all cruise vessels. Social distancing13.          In order to reduce the risk of local transmission, we will introduce requirements and advisories for events and gatherings, workplaces and public venues. This is to limit large crowds gathering in close proximity over a prolonged duration. Advisory for events and gatherings14.          All ticketed cultural, sports and entertainment events, with 250 participants or more, are to be deferred or cancelled. For events that have already been committed (e.g. tickets sold), organisers must demonstrate that satisfactory precautionary measures have been put in place before they can proceed.  15.          For all other mass gatherings including private functions and religious services, organisers are advised to put in place the following precautions:a.            Reduce the scale of events to below 250 participants where possible;b.            Reduce the crowding of participants and improve ventilation. For example, participants could be seated at least a metre apart from one another, and be advised to reduce contact with others (e.g. avoid shaking hands);c.             Put in place temperature and health screening measures, as well as turn away persons who are unwell; andd.            Put in place measures to facilitate contact tracing if needed, such as obtaining contact details of participants.16.          Participants are also advised to practise social responsibility - monitor their own health condition and avoid attending gatherings and events if unwell. Advisory for workplaces17.          Employers are advised to put in place measures to reduce close contact where feasible. For example, employers should implement tele-commuting and video-conferencing where possible, as well as stagger work hours, and allow employees to commute at off-peak hours. Seating in meeting rooms and work stations could also be spaced apart.  Advisory for public venues18.          Owners/ tenants of venues which are accessible to the public are advised to put in place measures to reduce close contact by patrons/customers, where possible. For instance:a.            Dining venues could set seats at least a metre apart;b.            Entertainment venues and tourist attractions (e.g. casinos, cinemas, theme parks, museums, and galleries) could limit the number of visitors at any one time, and/or increase spacing among visitors; andc.             Sports centres with indoor facilities (e.g. gyms, private academies) could limit the number of patrons, introduce physical separation measures, increase the frequency of cleaning, as well as issue advisories to reduce unnecessary contact, and practise public hygiene.19.          The above advisories for events, gatherings, workplaces and public venues will be subject to further review based on the global situation.MINISTRY OF HEALTH13 MARCH 20201 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' advisory issued on 8 January 2020 against travelling to or remaining in Iran due to rising tensions in the Middle East remains in place.2 Persons returning from Hubei province are subject to quarantine.3 Places where foreign visitors serve out their SHN period can include hotels.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/additional-precautionary-measures-to-prevent-further-importation-and-spread-of-covid-19-cases

SGP,Asia,Singapore,20/3/2020,385,40,26.429,0,0,0,70.596,7.335,4.846,Stricter Safe Distancing Measures to Prevent Further Spread of Covid-19 Cases,"          Singapore will implement stricter safe distancing measures to reduce the risk of further local transmission of COVID-19, especially for vulnerable segments of the population.2.            Even as we tighten our borders and isolate all imported cases, we must also redouble our efforts within Singapore to prevent further spread of the virus. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has studied the pattern of transmission amongst the locally transmitted cases, and found that many were infected during events and social gatherings, and interactions between colleagues at workplaces. In view of this, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will introduce stricter safe distancing measures to limit close contact and large gatherings of people in close proximity over a prolonged duration.3.            These safe distancing measures must be stepped up urgently in tandem with our parallel efforts to tighten our borders, and to quarantine and ring-fence any infection clusters.  All of these efforts, combined with good personal hygiene and social responsibility, can help to suppress the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore. Safe distancing measures for the general populationEvents and gatherings4.            Between now and 30 June 2020, all events and gatherings with 250 or more participants in attendance at any one time must be suspended. This is an expansion of the previous requirement for ticketed cultural, sports and entertainment events to be limited to fewer than 250 participants.5.            For events and gatherings with fewer than 250 participants, organisers and event venue operators are required to implement the necessary precautionary measures to ensure separation of at least a metre between participants. These measures include spaced seating at events, and reducing mingling of participants such as during meal times.6.            Events and gatherings must also comply with the existing guidance, including:a.    Improving ventilation and advising participants to reduce contact with others;b.    Putting in place temperature and health screening measures, and turning away persons who are unwell; andc.    Putting in place measures to facilitate contact tracing if needed, such as obtaining contact details of participants. Public venues7.            Operators of venues which are accessible to the public are required to implement the necessary precautionary measures to ensure separation of at least a metre between patrons. For example:a.    Queues (e.g. outside restaurants, at retail stores) should be kept fast-moving. This could be done by ensuring that all checkout counters are open, and encouraging self-checkout to minimise contact with counter staff. Operators are encouraged to demarcate queues to ensure patrons queue at least a metre apart from one another;b.    Food and beverage venues should maintain a distance of at least one metre between tables, and between seats. Where seats are fixed, including our hawker centres, operators should ensure alternate seats are marked out.  Individuals and family members who wish to seat together should continue to do so, but there should be a safe distance maintained between different groups; andc.    Entertainment venues and attractions (e.g. cinemas/theatres, theme parks, casinos, museums and galleries) should adopt measures appropriate to their venue to ensure separation of at least a metre amongst patrons. This could include reducing operating capacity to provide more spacing, installing floor markers at queuing areas, and adopting chequerboard or alternate seating.8.            Members of the public are strongly advised to comply with safe distancing measures put in place by operators. Workplaces9.            Employers are strongly advised to put in place measures to reduce close physical interactions amongst employees. All employers should facilitate telecommuting for their employees to work from home. Tele-conferencing should also be used in place of physical meetings wherever possible.10.         For employees undertaking job roles or functions where telecommuting is not feasible, employers should take the following precautions:a.    Staggered working hours: Employers should implement staggered working hours (for both reporting and ending times) with minimally three one-hourly blocks and no more than 50 percent of total employees reporting to work within each one-hour block. Where possible, reporting and ending times should not coincide with peak-hour travel, especially if employees require the use of public transport.  b.    Reduce duration and proximity of physical interactions: Employers should provide for physical spacing (of at least one metre apart) between work stations. If there is a need for physical meetings, the number of attendees should be limited and the duration shortened. Seats in meeting rooms should also be spaced at least a metre apart.c.    Defer non-critical events and scale down critical work events: For critical work events that cannot be deferred, employers must limit these to no more than 250 participants at any point in time and put in place measures to ensure separation of at least a metre between participants. These include meals and mingling during the event.11.         The above requirements and advisories for events, gatherings, workplaces and public venues will be subject to further review based on the global and local situation. Additional safe distancing measures for seniors12.         According to the World Health Organization (WHO), individuals who are of older age or have underlying conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes) have a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection. In view of this, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will take extra precautions to safeguard the wellbeing of our seniors.Suspension of senior-centric activities13.         Since 11 March, all senior-centric activities at community clubs, residents’ committees, Senior Activity Centres, Active Ageing Hubs, CREST Centres, Health Promotion Board and ActiveSG sport centres have been suspended for two weeks. National Silver Academy (NSA) courses and volunteer programmes administered by the Council for Third Age have also been suspended for the same period.114.         To continue to safeguard our seniors’ wellbeing in the coming weeks, the suspension of the above activities will be extended for another 14 days, until 7 April. In addition, all organisers of activities that involve physical interactions amongst seniors should suspend such activities from 22 March to 7 April. These include senior-centric courses, activities and interest groups, as well as events, performances, and other gatherings targeted at seniors.15.         Organisers should put in place extra precautions in preparation for the resumption of organised activities after 7 April.16.         We encourage seniors to continue to be active during this period. Organisers of senior-centric activities are encouraged to organise activities which do not require close contact between seniors, such as by using online platforms. For example, seniors may tap on a new video series broadcast on zaobao.sg that brings exercise, singing and cooking activities online for them. Conducted by trainers from the People’s Association (PA), the video series enables active seniors to participate in these activities in the comfort of their own home.2 Advisory for seniors and caregivers17.         In addition to the safe distancing measures, we advise seniors to avoid crowded places as far as possible, and be vigilant in maintaining good personal hygiene, such as by washing their hands frequently and avoiding touching their face and eyes. Seniors who feel unwell should see a doctor.18.         Anyone interacting with seniors should also take extra care with personal hygiene. They should avoid interacting with seniors when they are unwell. Social responsibility is key19.         Social responsibility is a critical factor in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need all Singaporeans to play their part in the fight against COVID-19. Singaporeans should therefore uphold these safe distancing principles for their own private get-togethers, even if these are being carried out in smaller groups. This means reducing the frequency of such activities, and minimising physical contact with one another. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should see a doctor and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others.  We must all do our part to protect ourselves, our family and friends, and the people around us.  20.         The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will regularly review the safe distancing measures and calibrate them as the global and local situation evolves. Members of the public are advised to refer to the MOH website (https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19) for the latest measures.MINISTRY OF HEALTH20 MARCH 2020 [1] The list of activities which are suspended can be found on PA’s and MyActiveSG’s websites, as well as the Health Promotion Board’s HealthHub portal or Healthy 365 mobile app.[2] The initiative is a collaboration between the Ministry of Communications and Information, PA and Singapore Press Holdings’ Chinese Media Group. Key messages on good hygiene practices will also be weaved into this programme to remind seniors of the important measures they can take to protect themselves.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/stricter-safe-distancing-measures-to-prevent-further-spread-of-covid-19-cases

She was admitted to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) on 23 February for pneumonia, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on the same day. She had been cared for in the intensive care unit (ICU) since admission to NCID. She developed serious complications and eventually succumbed to the infection after 26 days in the ICU on 21 March at 7.52am. She had a history of chronic heart disease and hypertension. 3.            The second patient was a 64 year-old male Indonesian national. He was admitted in critical condition to the ICU at NCID on 13 March, after arriving in Singapore from Indonesia on the same day, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 14 March. He had been cared for in the ICU since 13 March. He developed serious complications and eventually succumbed to the infection after nine days in the ICU on 21 March at 10.15am. Prior to his arrival in Singapore on 13 March, he had been hospitalised in Indonesia for pneumonia, and had a history of heart disease.4.            Minister for Health Mr Gan Kim Yong said, “We are deeply saddened by their passing. Our thoughts are with their families during this difficult time. We will render all necessary assistance to their families. I understand that Singaporeans will be affected by this news. But we must take courage and continue to play our part to fight this virus.” 5.            The Ministry of Health and NCID have reached out to their families and are extending assistance to them.

SGP,Asia,Singapore,24/3/2020,558,49,41.714,2,0,0,102.318,8.985,7.649,Tighter Measures to Minimise Further Spread of Covid-19,"          The recent spike in imported cases signals a new phase in our fight against COVID-19. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce recently disbarred all short-term visitors from entering or transiting through Singapore, and further curtailed the entry of work pass holders. We have also implemented safe distancing measures within Singapore.  But more still needs to be done to reduce the risk of further local transmission of COVID-19.  Safe Distancing Measures for the General Population2.            Many countries have imposed total lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus. Such lockdowns have significantly disrupted lives and economies throughout the world, but were deemed necessary to ease the strain on healthcare systems in those countries.3.            We therefore cannot afford to be complacent in Singapore. We must implement tighter safe distancing measures now to minimise activities and exposure, so as to significantly reduce the risks of seeding new local clusters. For safe distancing to be effective, all Singaporeans must take it seriously and do their part.  Otherwise, we will need more drastic measures later.4.            The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has decided to enforce stricter measures that would limit gatherings outside of work and school to 10 persons or fewer, and ensure that physical distancing of at least one metre can be achieved in settings where interactions are non-transient. These measures will take effect from 26 March 2020, 2359 hours.  We expect these measures to be in place until 30 April 2020, but this may be extended if the situation does not improve.  Entertainment Venues5.            We will close all bars and entertainment venues like night clubs, discos, cinemas, theatres, and karaoke outlets, where there is a high risk of transmission due to sustained close contact over a period of time.6.            Other public venues such as retail malls, museums and attractions, where contact is more transient, may remain open. However, operators are to ensure the following:a.            Reduce operating capacity within the venue at any one time, so that the venue does not have more than one person per 16 square metres of usable space. This is to significantly reduce the density of crowds in these venues, especially during peak periods.b.            Groups must not exceed 10 persons. Shows within attractions (indoor and outdoor), group tours at the museums, and open atrium sales events1 will be suspended.c.             Disperse congregations and provide an environment that allows at least one metre physical spacing between patrons. These include queues and waiting areas. Operators are encouraged to offer services by appointment or through digital services where possible, to minimise queues. Crowds should be quickly dispersed.  7.            Retail malls and attractions that are unable to adhere to these requirements must be closed. Additional penalties may be imposed on those which are found to have been a place of transmission of COVID-19, if the venues are found not to have adhered to these requirements.8.            Organised tours in public venues (e.g., sightseeing or guided walking tours) will be suspended.9.            Existing measures for food and beverage venues continue to apply. Other activities such as live music or karaoke which are likely to cause patrons to congregate will have to cease. Food and beverage outlets must set up their spaces (arrangement of tables and seating) to ensure separation of at least one metre between tables or different groups of diners.•             Related diners (e.g. family members, couples) can be seated together at one table, but the tables must be spaced out.•             Groups of diners should also be limited to 10 persons or fewer.Patrons of eating establishments with fixed seating – for example, hawker centres and coffee shops – must use alternate seats. Premise managers should mark out seats to facilitate these arrangements.  Tuition and Enrichment Centres10.          All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes will be suspended. This is to reduce the intermingling of students from different schools and enhance the safety of our students.  Faith-based Activities11.          All religious services and congregations will be suspended. Places of worship (e.g. temples, mosques, churches) may remain open for private worship and essential rites, subject to group sizes of 10 persons or fewer at any one time.   Events12.          All events and mass gatherings (e.g. conferences, exhibitions, festivals, concerts, sporting events, trade fairs) must be deferred or cancelled, regardless of size. This is a tightening of the previous requirement where all events and gatherings were to be limited to fewer than 250 participants.13.          Singaporeans are advised to avoid holding and participating in social events and gatherings involving more than 10 persons at any one time. These include private celebrations like birthdays and weddings. For funerals and wakes, attendance should be limited as far as possible to family members only, and gatherings of 10 or fewer people at any one point. Much as we understand the need for friends and acquaintances to pay their last respects and give comfort to families in their grief, we urge the public to do their part in minimising social interactions so that we can slow down the spread of the virus together.  Workplaces14.          Existing measures for workplaces continue to apply. Employers should put in place measures to reduce close physical interactions amongst employees. Tele-conferencing should be used in place of physical meetings wherever possible. Where employees can perform their work by telecommuting from home, employers must ensure that they do so. Advisory for Seniors and Persons with Underlying Conditions15.          We will extend the suspension of activities for seniors2 to 30 April 2020. During this time, we advise seniors and individuals with underlying chronic medical conditions (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, lung disease) to avoid social gatherings and crowded places as far as possible, and to only go out for essential purposes (e.g. work, purchase food and supplies). They should be vigilant in maintaining good personal hygiene, such as by washing their hands frequently and avoiding touching their face and eyes unnecessarily. They should see a doctor immediately if they feel unwell.Enhanced Precautions for UK/US Returnees16.          The UK and US account for the largest share of imported cases by far. We expect more Singapore residents, including a sizeable group of Singaporean students, to return from these countries over the coming weeks in response to lockdowns in these countries. 17.          To prevent potential spread of infection from the UK and US returnees to their family members, we will work with hotel operators to provide dedicated facilities for the returnees to serve their 14-day SHN. Transportation will be arranged to send the returnees directly from the airport to the hotels. Each will have their own room/toilet, and will be provided all their meals, so that they may avoid physical contact with other individuals. These SHN requirements will be strictly enforced so as to reduce the risk of community transmission from imported cases. 18.          This new SHN arrangement will take effect for all UK/US returnees from 25 March 2020, 2359 hours. All returnees from the UK and US who are presently still serving out their SHN in their homes may also apply to stay in these dedicated facilities. They can contact the SHN Helpline at 6812-5555 for more information. Regulations Under the Infectious Disease Act19.          The Ministry of Health (MOH) will be promulgating Regulations under the Infectious Diseases Act to give legal force to the safe distancing measures, as well as to provide enhanced enforcement for breaches of the SHN. The penalty for an offence under the Regulations, including any SHN breach, would be a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to six months or both. In addition, existing levers under the Infectious Diseases Act, including the temporary suspension of operations, may be used against persons and operators found to be non-compliant with the Regulations.20.          Government agencies will also step up enforcement efforts against persons on SHN, using a combination of mobile applications, phone surveillance and house visits. The number of officers conducting such checks will be increased substantially to tighten enforcement efforts. Detailed checks will also be carried out to verify the declared addresses of returning residents on the SHN forms. To provide expeditious support to persons on SHN, a centralised call centre will be set up from 26 March 2020 to handle all SHN-related queries. Singapore Residents and Long-Term Pass Holders who Disregard Travel Advisory21.          MOH has noted that there are still Singapore residents and Long Term Pass holders who are travelling abroad even after the Government issued travel advisories. They risk the health of other Singaporeans and residents when they return.22.          Any Singapore resident or Long Term Pass holder who leaves Singapore from 27 March 2020, in disregard of the prevailing travel advisories, will be charged at unsubsidised rates for their inpatient stay at public hospitals, if they are admitted for suspected COVID-19 and have onset of symptoms within 14 days of returning to Singapore. Singapore residents will also not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans for these treatments at public and private hospitals.23.          Any work pass holder or his/her dependant who leaves Singapore from 27 March 2020 will be deprioritised for entry approval3 and could see significant delays before they are allowed to return to Singapore if they persist in travelling abroad and return infected.  Commencement of Community Isolation Facility24.          Even as we take further steps to minimise further spread of the disease, MOH is making the necessary preparations to cope with a possible surge. This includes ensuring that our healthcare facilities are able to cope with a larger number of cases.25.          We have set up a Community Isolation Facility at D’Resort NTUC (1 Pasir Ris Close) with maximum capacity of about 500 persons, which is operational from 24 March 2020. We will be placing patients who are clinically well enough to be discharged from medical care but still test positive for COVID-19 to the facility for isolation and care. These patients have thus far been isolated in our hospitals. But this has not been an efficient use of our hospital resources as they do not generally require significant medical care.26.          The Community Isolation Facility is modelled after the existing Government Quarantine Facilities, and will be managed with a higher baseline level of infection control by staff. Patients who are clinically fit for discharge but are still COVID-19 positive will be isolated and safely managed in this facility until after they test negative for COVID-19. The cost of isolation in the Community Isolation Facility will be borne by the Government. Social Responsibility is Key27.          Social responsibility is critical in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need all Singaporeans to play their part in the fight against COVID-19. Everyone should observe the safe distancing measures announced, and fully comply with the quarantine order and SHN issued by authorities. All travel plans should also be deferred until the global outbreak is under control. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should see a doctor immediately and stay at home to prevent spreading illness to others. 28.          During this time, it is important to look after our own and each other’s wellbeing. Seniors especially should find ways to stay fit and healthy even while at home, stay socially connected through phone or other means, or pick up a new hobby or skill through online learning.29.          We understand these measures are disruptive and require significant effort from all of us to adjust to them. However we must all do our part to protect ourselves, our family and friends, and the people around us.30.          The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will regularly review its measures and calibrate them as the global and local situation evolves. Members of the public are advised to refer to the MOH website (https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19) for the latest measures. MINISTRY OF HEALTH24 MARCH 2020 1  Except for supermarket retailers where atrium sales may be used to disperse crowds from their stores.2  Since 11 March 2020, all senior-centric activities at community clubs, residents’ committees, Senior Activity Centres, Active Ageing Hubs, CREST Centres, Health Promotion Board (HPB) and ActiveSG sport centres had been suspended for two weeks.

This arrangement will continue to apply to returnees from the UK and US.  2.            The dedicated SHN facilities are not just about the provision of hotel rooms. We also work with the hotel operators to provide training for their staff, and to put in place proper security arrangements, as well as infection control and precautions. It takes time to get ready such facilities, and we do not have enough at present to accommodate all returnees. Therefore based on the current capacity, we have prioritised the facilities for returnees from these specific countries. The countries are chosen based on our assessment of risks and the history of imported cases in Singapore. For those who are coming back from other countries, they can serve their 14-day SHN at their place of residence. 3.            The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to monitor the dynamic and evolving COVID-19 situation, and work closely with the private sector to adjust our capacity of SHN facilities accordingly.

SGP,Asia,Singapore,10/4/2020,2108,198,142,7,1,0.286,386.534,36.306,26.038,Changes to Childcare Arrangements During Circuit Breaker,"          The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has announced that parents should not send their children to the care of their grandparents on a daily basis during this circuit breaker period. This is to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 infection through regular interactions between households, and to protect our vulnerable seniors. The Taskforce will allow exemptions to support our essential service workers during this period. 2.            The Taskforce implemented an elevated set of safe distancing measures from 7 April till 4 May 2020, as a circuit breaker to pre-empt the trend of increasing local transmission of COVID-19. The aim is to limit the spread of the disease by significantly reducing movement and social interactions. 3.            As part of these measures, members of the public are to stay at home, and not go out unnecessarily except to purchase daily necessities, essential services, or for urgent medical needs. Seniors are most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection. Hence seniors are strongly urged to stay home and minimise interactions with those outside their household.  Individuals can visit the elderly to assist them with their daily needs such as bringing them groceries, food and other essential supplies, but interaction time should be kept to a minimum.  Protecting grandparents from risk of infection 4.            During this period, parents are encouraged to care for their children within their own households. Employers are requested to exercise the necessary flexibility to support parents who are working from home during this time, as having to care for their children personally might take a toll on their work productivity.5.            If it is the existing care arrangement for the child to be placed under the care of their grandparents who live outside the household and there are no alternative care arrangements, parents could consider placing their children with their grandparents throughout the entire circuit breaker period. This is to minimise frequent interactions across households. 6.            We recognise that many parents will find this a difficult adjustment, especially if they have always had daily childcare support from grandparents or pre-schools/ childcare centres. However, this is done out of necessity to protect our seniors. Flexibility to be exercised for families with essential service workers7.            While most parents would be working from home, there would be some households where parents have to continue going to work during this period. These are workers in our essential services, especially our healthcare workers who are on the frontline working on shifts and on weekends, when childcare centres may not be available, and may be activated at any time of the day to respond to the COVID-19 situation.  They will face additional difficulties which may be unnecessarily stressful for these essential service personnel. For very young children, we also recognise that it is difficult for them to be away from their parents for long periods of time, and adjusting to new caregivers that they are unfamiliar with would be challenging.   8.            Therefore we will be implementing exemptions for the following families, where they may continue to tap on the grandparents for childcare support on a daily basis: a.            Both parents are essential service workers and unable to work from home;b.            One parent is a healthcare professional (e.g. doctor, nurse, allied health professional, support care staff) and is unable to work from home; andc.             One parent is an essential service worker who is unable to work from home, and have a child/children below the age of three.9.          Parents requiring assistance may contact ECDA at contact@ecda.gov.sg or 67359213. Safe distancing precautions to protect seniors10.          Families who are relying on the grandparents for childcare on a daily basis are advised to take the necessary safe distancing precautions to protect the elderly. Observe personal hygiene and try to reduce interaction time as far as possible when visiting their home. Do not visit when unwell.  11.          We understand that this is a very difficult adjustment for many families, and these measures go against the instinct to be close to and to support our loved ones. But our elderly are most susceptible to severe COVID-19 infection, and we should refrain from exposing them to the risk of COVID-19 as far as possible, by minimising physical interactions with them.   MINISTRY OF HEALTH10 APRIL 2020",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/changes-to-childcare-arrangements-during-circuit-breaker

In all, 560 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.2.             As of 12 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 233 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows: a)   Imported cases: 0b)   Linked to known clusters: 51c)   Linked to other cases: 15d)   Pending contact tracing: 167, of which 16 are Singapore Citizens/ Permanent Residents and 10 are Work Pass or Long Term Pass holders residing in our community; and 141 are Work Permit holders, mostly residing in dormitories, work sites and other living quarters.  3.             We have provided a breakdown of the trend of daily cases based on the different transmission types (see Annex A). As seen from the chart, the number of imported cases rose around mid-March due to the large number of returnees but has since come down to zero. The number of cases in the community increased following the wave of new imported cases, but there has been some moderation in recent days, in light of the safe-distancing measures that have been put in place earlier. The number of work permit and dormitory-related cases has also increased sharply, and this is likely to continue going up, especially as we undertake more aggressive testing at the dormitories.4.             Contact tracing and investigation are underway for currently unlinked cases to establish any links to known clusters or previous cases. In the past week (5 April to 11 April), MOH has uncovered links for 229 previously unlinked cases.Links between previous cases found5.             Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

We conducted enhanced surveillance and testing, tightened our border controls and mobilised the whole population to work with the government to practice safe distancing and a high level of personal hygiene.  6.      In recent weeks, we have seen a spike in the number of cases, with the majority of new cases involving foreign workers from dormitories. We have formed a special Inter-Agency Taskforce, with our Senior Minister as advisor, to contain the spread and protect our foreign workers. Workers are being tested extensively. We have set up medical facilities in the dormitories to provide them with medical care and are paying close attention to their needs and well-being. Our foreign workers played an important part in building Singapore and we will do our best to take care of them.  7.      The pandemic has triggered many nations to shut their borders, limit exports and halt economic activities; causing severe disruptions and creating uncertainties.  8.      The COVID-19 pandemic is likely to take some time to be resolved, maybe till end of the year and beyond. But the impact on our economy and our society will last much longer. Singapore introduced a package of fiscal measures totalling S$60 billion (~US$42 billion, or ~12% of our GDP) to cushion the impact. These measures will help support workers and protect livelihoods, help enterprises overcome immediate challenges and strengthen economic and social resilience so that we can emerge stronger.  9.      Our societies have to adjust and adapt to the new normal. As leaders, we need to strengthen solidarity and forge a resilient society, to help the vulnerable among us, so that no one is left behind.  10.     Our healthcare and front-line workers have been working around the clock to care for our patients. I would like to thank them for their dedication and commitment. We are also heartened to see the whole nation united under the SGUnited initiative, where individuals and organisations are volunteering, donating, supporting our efforts and helping the needy among us.  11.     No country can fight the virus alone. Therefore, countries should share experience and expertise, embrace stronger international cooperation, particularly in research and vaccine development. The virus will not be truly contained anywhere unless it is effectively contained everywhere.  12.     The actions we collectively take today can and will determine the course of the disease globally. Now is the time for unity, for the international community to work together in solidarity to stop this virus.  13.     Beyond COVID-19, we must also collaborate globally and share ideas on many important health issues and challenges to deliver better health for our people. 14.     Singapore is grateful to be part of this important discussion and look forward to working closely with the G20, WHO and the wider international community in these areas. Thank you.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/minister-for-health-gan-kim-yong's-delivered-intervention-for-g20-health-ministers-meeting-19-apr-2020

Since the start of the outbreak, a total of 1,095 COVID-19 patients, out of 14,423 confirmed cases, have recovered and been discharged. The number of COVID-19 related deaths has remained low, at 14 deaths.[1] Our healthcare workers will continue to do their best to keep the complications and deaths arising from COVID-19 as low as possible. Medical Plan2.             The clinical and scientific data from managing COVID-19 patients, as well as the current epidemiological evidence on the infection, have provided the bases for a comprehensive medical plan. The plan guides the admission of patients into the appropriate tiered facilities for medical care and support, the transfer of patients between these facilities according to their needs, and the discharge of patients who are well and no longer infectious. The aim here is to deploy our medical resources optimally so as to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.3.             The majority of patients picked up by our testing have mild or no symptoms. Such patients are generally admitted to a Community Care Facility (CCF) where most recover with minimal intervention. Patients in these facilities are monitored closely in case they need to be transferred to hospital for better management and support. Those with severe conditions are cared for in Intensive Care Units (ICU). Such patients may display serious symptoms or have other risk factors and co-morbidities. As of 27 April, 12pm, there are 1,451 COVID-19 cases in hospitals, and 20 in ICU.4.             Infectious disease experts have studied the progression of COVID-19 infections in patients. Patients who remain well at Day 14 of illness are likely to remain clinically stable and generally do not require any further medical care. We transfer such patients to a step-down Community Recovery Facility (CRF). Those who have been previously admitted into our hospitals may also be transferred to a CRF when they recover from their acute illness.5.             To support this plan, we have established a number of CCFs and CRFs. We have also augmented our healthcare workforce and deployed them to provide the appropriate level of care in the different facilities and settings, according to the needs of patients.Scaling Up of Medical Facilities6.             Persons with acute respiratory infections but are clinically well are issued with five-day medical certificates and are asked to isolate themselves at home. Those who meet the clinical case definitions for COVID-19 are tested and asked to self-isolate at home as they await their test results. Those who are unable to self-isolate in their homes can do so in a Swab Isolation Facility (SIF) while awaiting their test results. To date, we have built a capacity of 4,000 beds in the SIFs, in locations such as Civil Service Club @ Loyang and hotels. Those who are clinically unwell are referred immediately to hospitals for further assessment and treatment.7.             The CCF capacity has been rapidly increased, starting with about 500 beds at D’Resort NTUC to about 10,000 spaces currently, including at the Singapore EXPO and Changi Exhibition Centre. We are continuing to expand our CCFs, aiming to double their capacity to 20,000 beds by end-June. This includes the CCFs we are setting up within some of the migrant worker dormitories so that workers with mild symptoms can be quickly isolated and monitored, with the medical posts deployed in the dormitories providing the necessary medical support.8.             We now have a capacity of over 2,000 beds in CRF sites, situated in several SAF camps. We have started to move some patients from CCF to CRF and will monitor their progress with a view to scaling up the CRF to accommodate more patients. We intend to ramp up our CRF capacity to more than 10,000 beds by end-June.9.             To ensure that there is available hospital capacity to care for COVID-19 patients, public hospitals have postponed non-urgent elective procedures. New capacity in isolation wards and intensive care units have been created by repurposing existing beds and hospital facilities, and acquiring additional medical equipment such as ventilators. In addition, public hospitals have established collaborations with private sector healthcare providers to provide further treatment capacity, and to help care for existing patients with chronic medical conditions. Private hospitals continue to support our public hospitals in attending to patients with less serious acute clinical conditions. Healthcare institutions have also started teleconsultation services for follow-up on their patients.Augmenting our Healthcare Workforce10.             This expansion of our medical facilities has to be supported by a healthcare workforce. We have taken a two-pronged approach: One, we have tapped on private sector healthcare professionals, retirees and volunteers; and two, we are making full use of technology as an enabler.11.             The Ministry of Health (MOH) has sought the support of healthcare professionals in the private sector, and encouraged them to join the newly launched SG Healthcare Corps. Since its launch on 7 April, about 3,000 healthcare professionals across all job groups have signed up. MOH will be expanding the SG Healthcare Corps to include more healthcare professionals, as well as non-healthcare professionals. We are also re-deploying manpower from industries affected by COVID-19 to enable them to take on new roles in our hospitals. For example, Singapore Airlines (SIA) cabin crew are filling the role of care ambassadors. They provide administrative support and attend to patients, under the supervision of nursing staff.12.             We are also leveraging technology to deliver the same or enhanced outcomes with less time and effort. For instance, round-the-clock care in CCFs is made possible by the use of medical kiosks and teleconsultations. Devices such as pulse oximeters and health apps are used to monitor patient well-being.Whole-of-Society Effort13.             We have been able to mobilise our medical facilities and provide such enhanced support within a very short time because of a Whole-of-Society effort, bringing together government agencies and the private sector. For example, the CCF site at Singapore Expo was made possible through the hard work of people across multiple organisations including Temasek Holdings, Singapore Expo (as venue operator), Surbana Jurong (to set up the facility), IHiS (tech enablement such as care management, electronic medical records and vital signs monitoring), Resorts World Sentosa (as managing agent), PSA (project management), ST Engineering (tech solutions), Certis Cisco (to provide security), Parkway Pantai, Woodlands Health Campus and the Singapore Armed Forces (to provide the medical teams).Likewise, the CCF at Changi Exhibition Centre was set up and run by MINDEF-affiliated organisations, along with partners such as Experia Events (venue owner), Surbana Jurong (as design consultant), the Defence Science and Technology Agency as well as DSO National Laboratories (tech solution providers like temperature screening and cleaning of PPEs), ST Engineering (to provide robots for food delivery), Mandarin Oriental (managing agent) and Raffles Medical Group (for medical care).    14.             We appreciate the contributions of everyone who has worked round the clock to make all this happen, and who are continuing to serve in different roles in our national medical plan. Through their combined efforts, we are able to take care of all infected patients, and ensure we have sufficient healthcare capacity for the longer term. COVID-19 may be with us for a long time, and we must have sufficient capacity to care for everyone who is ill. The expanded healthcare facilities and manpower will put us on a strong footing as we plan ahead for the gradual relaxation of the circuit breaker measures.    [1] As of 27 April 2020, 12pm.

At the same time, we are preparing for the safe and gradual resumption of economic and community activities after the end of the circuit breaker period on 1 June 2020. We will be tapping on digital solutions, such as the SafeEntry check-in system, and deploying them more pervasively when we resume these activities.2.             With everyone playing their part and observing safe distancing measures, we have seen a significant decrease in community transmission over the past month. The average daily number of new cases in the community has dropped by more than half, from 25 in the week before, to 12 in the past week.3.             That said, we are not out of the woods. There are still unlinked cases in the community and new clusters may form if we let our guard down. We must be cautious in how we lift the restrictions, and put in place further safeguards even as we do so.Gradual Reopening of Work Premises and Economy4.             We plan to phase in the reopening of work premises, taking into account their importance to the economy and supply chains, their contribution to local employment, and their ability to minimise risks of transmission at their workplaces. To do so safely, we will impose more stringent requirements on all employers and firms.5.             In particular, all companies must put in place safe management practices as an integral part of their operations. This means proactively identifying situations and practices which have higher infection risks, and implementing appropriate precautions and safeguards.6.             For example, companies must continue to allow staff to work from home wherever possible; enforce safe distancing amongst their employees at the workplace; stagger working hours and break times; and ensure no cross-deployment of staff across teams or worksites. They should also require every employee to wear a mask at work, and ensure that there are no gatherings amongst their staff (i.e. they should not be interacting at staff canteens, or going out in groups during lunch breaks). Further details on the specific workplace measures will be announced by the Ministry of Manpower, Ministry of Trade and Industry and relevant agencies in due course.7.             Over the coming weeks, we will work closely with the Trade Associations and Business Chambers to engage businesses and help them prepare to meet the more stringent safe management requirements when they reopen.Gradual Resumption of Selected Activities and Services8.             The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will allow the gradual resumption of selected activities and services in the coming weeks, subject to the necessary safe management measures being in place.9.             From 5 May 2020, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) needle acupuncture will be allowed, for pain management only (excluding cupping, moxibustion, guasha and tuina manipulative therapies), if assessed by the TCM practitioner to be essential. TCM halls with registered TCM practitioners will also be allowed to sell retail products. This is on top of the consultation and herbal dispensary services which they are already allowed to provide.10.            From 5 May 2020, residents living in strata-titled residential buildings may exercise within the common areas of these private residential developments such as footpaths, but must continue to practise safe distancing measures. In other words, the same rules that apply in public areas will also apply within the common areas of these developments. Enforcement officers will conduct periodic checks and inspections, and the Management Corporations (MCST) and Managing Agents should also do their part to ensure compliance with these measures. All sports and recreational facilities within these private residential developments such as playgrounds, pools, gyms, barbecue pits and club houses are to remain closed.11.             From 12 May 2020, the following will be allowed to resume operations:a.    Manufacturing and onsite preparation of all food, including cakes and confectionery, ice cream, cocoa, chocolate and chocolate products, and other snacks;b.    Retail outlets of food, including cakes and confectionery, packaged snacks and desserts, may be open for takeaway and delivery only;c.    Home-based food businesses may operate, but only for delivery or collection. Home-based private dining will not be allowed. Delivery and collection of food orders should be done in a safe and contactless manner, by appointment so that it can be spaced out, and there is no bunching of people. Details will be provided separately;d.    Retail laundry services;e.    Barbers and hairdressers, for basic haircut services; andf.     Retail of pet supplies.12.             The list of activities that will be allowed to operate, and relevant further information, will be updated at https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/essentialservices.13.             Learning has continued during the circuit breaker period through Home-Based Learning. But we recognise the anxiety amongst students and parents of graduating cohorts, who have to take the national examinations this year. From 19 May 2020, schools will bring back students from graduating cohorts in small groups for face-to-face consultations and lessons. Priority will be given to students requiring school facilities for coursework and practical sessions, and those who need additional support and remediation during the school vacation period. Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), especially the Institute of Technical Education, will also bring back small groups of students on campus for critical consultations, projects or practicums. We will stagger the students’ return to schools and IHLs throughout the day. They will practise safe distancing and safe management measures, such as keeping to separate groups within their cohort.14.             In the migrant worker dormitories, the number of cases is still high. The restriction on daily movement of workers in and out of all dormitories (i.e. Purpose Built Dormitories, Factory Converted Dormitories, Construction Temporary Quarters and Temporary Occupation Licence quarters) will therefore be extended to the end of the circuit breaker period, i.e. until 1 June 2020 (inclusive). This will minimise the risk of further community transmission of COVID-19.15.             The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will closely observe the trends over the coming weeks, and adjust further as necessary.Leveraging Technology to Enable Safe Resumption of Activities16.             There will likely still be some cases in our community even after the circuit breaker period. We must be able to quickly contact trace and isolate close contacts of these infected individuals. We will leverage technology to speed up contact tracing, so that we can more effectively prevent the formation of new infection clusters, and enable the safe resumption of activities.17.             SafeEntry was deployed by the Government on 23 April 2020 to log the names, NRIC/FINs and mobile numbers of individuals visiting hotspots, workplaces of essential services, as well as selected public venues. Such details are necessary for the Government to carry out contact tracing quickly and effectively, should the need arise. Users check-in by scanning a QR code displayed at the venue with their phone, or by having any identification card with a barcode scanned e.g. NRIC, driver’s licence, student pass and work permit.18.             To further support our contact tracing efforts, SafeEntry must be deployed extensively across Singapore, especially at places with a higher risk of non-transient contact. This would include workplaces, malls and supermarkets. From 12 May 2020, all businesses and services that are in operation must come on board the SafeEntry system to log the check-in and check-out of employees and visitors.19.             At places with transient populations on-the-move such as MRT stations and parks, there will not be mandatory SafeEntry checkpoints. But QR codes will be put up, and we encourage the public to scan in so that they may be reached should the need for contact tracing arise. Contact data collected by SafeEntry is only used by authorised personnel for contact tracing purposes, and stringent measures are in place to safeguard the data in accordance with the Government’s data security standards. We will announce details of the list of venues for deployment in the next few days.20.             We are also working to improve our digital tools to enable speedier contact tracing. In the meantime, we encourage more Singaporeans to download and actively use the TraceTogether app. The app uses Bluetooth proximity data to establish close contact between two users. We are working with Apple/Google to make the app more effective on iOS phones. We are also looking into solutions for groups like the elderly and the young who do not have smartphones. We will announce more details in the coming weeks.Social Responsibility is Key21.             Social responsibility is critical in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Even as the circuit breaker measures are gradually eased, all of us should continue to stay at home as much as possible, and minimise movement outside the home. In the community and at workplaces, we must keep up good habits such as safe distancing, personal hygiene and wearing of masks. This must be our new normal in a COVID-19 world.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/easing-the-tighter-circuit-breaker-measures-preparing-for-gradual-resumption-of-activity-after-1-june

Ten cases are Singaporeans/ Permanent Residents, many of whom are linked cases.2.             We are still working through the details of the cases, and further updates will be shared via the MOH press release that will be issued tonight.3.             The number of cases amongst migrant workers has been fluctuating in recent days due to clearance of backlogged cases by one laboratory.

SGP,Asia,Singapore,4/5/2020,18778,573,622.143,18,0,0.571,3443.23,105.068,114.079,"Ministerial Statement by Mr Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Health, At Parliament, On the Second Update On Whole-of-government Response to Covid-19, 4 May 2020","Update on Transmission Trends1.            Mr Speaker, Sir, thank you for allowing me to update members again on the COVID-19 situation and address some of their questions.2.            When I spoke in March 2020, we were seeing the centre of the pandemic shift away from China, and a rapid increase in cases globally. Close to 80% of our cases then were imported, mainly from returning Singaporeans. We tightened our border controls and our import cases have drastically reduced. In the past week, we had no imported cases, down from around 16 a day on average in March.3.            At the same time, we have seen a rise in community cases from 9 a day in March to 31 a day on average in the week before circuit breaker, with an increasing proportion of unlinked cases, suggesting that there is underlying community transmission. We decided to do the hard thing, to impose circuit breaker measures from 7 April 2020, and introduced stricter measures following that on 21 April 2020. We also extended the circuit breaker measures to 1 June 2020.4.            There are signs that our circuit breaker measures are working. The average number of new community cases had fallen from 31 in the week before the circuit breaker, to 11 last week. The average number of new unlinked community cases a day had similarly reduced from 12 to 5 over the same period. This suggests that our circuit breaker measures are effective. Let me take this chance to acknowledge the many sacrifices of our people, workers and businesses during these past few weeks of the circuit breaker. It has not been easy, but you have all played a part in bringing these numbers down and I want to express my heartfelt gratitude. But we are not out of the woods yet.5.            While the community cases are coming under control, we have seen a rise in migrant worker cases, particularly in the dormitories. We moved in quickly, set up medical posts in all the purpose built dormitories and provided mobile medical support for the factory converted dormitories. The Ministry of Health (MOH) worked with the Interagency Task Force led by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) to ensure the medical needs and welfare of the workers are taken care of.  We are grateful for the assistance of the Task Force members including the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF) and our healthcare workers from our public healthcare institutions as well as from the private sector. We are making progress, and will continue to do our best to care for our migrant workers. Minister Teo will elaborate on this in her statement.6.            Notwithstanding stringent precautions, there have also been cases at our Nursing Homes and at one Welfare Home. As these facilities serve the elderly who are a vulnerable group, we take such cases very seriously. MOH has ramped up more aggressive testing for staff and residents at these Homes, working jointly with the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF). This is to protect our vulnerable seniors, by quickly picking out hidden cases if any, to isolate them and care for them, and thus protect the rest of the Homes’ residents and staff. We have started this, but it will take some time to complete. Meanwhile, we may see cases picked up at these Homes as a result of the active screening. In addition, we are also arranging lodging for staff who interact with residents at designated accommodation facilities on-site or at hotels, to reduce their exposure to the community during this circuit breaker period. Both these steps complement existing safe distancing and infection control measures, so as to enhance protection to our seniors in these homes.7.            Overall, despite our high case numbers, we have managed to keep death rates low so far. This is partly because most of our patients are younger and partly due to the tireless efforts of our healthcare workers providing good and timely medical care for all our COVID-infected patients. We must continue to do all we can to save patients who become gravely ill, and keep fatalities as low as possible.8.            In preparation for the expected increase in the number of cases, especially from the dormitories, we have rapidly expanded our healthcare capacity.  This includes both medical facilities, as well as healthcare manpower.9.            We have seen countries whose healthcare systems were overwhelmed, and this quickly led to high numbers of death among patients. Ms. Irene Quay has asked if we have an ethical framework to allocate use of healthcare resources. We are working hard to avoid getting to this point. We have planned ahead, created and ramped up many different types of healthcare facilities to support the specific needs of COVID-19 patients. In addition, our healthcare system has the flexibility to stretch our capacity to respond to increasing demand. Let me elaborate.10.          Hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds. To ensure that there is available hospital capacity to care for COVID-19 patients, public hospitals have postponed non-urgent elective procedures, and discharged medically stable long-stayers to step-down care facilities. Public hospitals have also repurposed and converted existing wards into isolation rooms, and progressively opened more wards for COVID-19 patients. Our number of isolation beds has increased from around 550 in January this year, to close to 1,500 as of 2 May 2020. The National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) has also increased their capacity from about 100 to more than 500 negative pressure isolation beds in the same period.11.          Currently, 22 COVID-19 patients are in our ICU, as the majority of the cases are mild. We have about 150 vacant ICU beds, and can quickly bring another 300 online. But we are not taking any chances as we must preserve our buffer capacity.  Mr. Leon Perera had asked about our ability to further ramp up. The public hospitals have put in place plans to ensure that their infrastructure, equipment, medications and manpower are in place to add another 450 ICU beds by mid-May if needed. We have also ensured a sufficient supply of ventilators and other ICU accessories to support the care of ICU patients.12.          Community Care Facilities. The majority of our COVID-19 cases have only mild symptoms. Hence, we have expanded our medical facilities to care for patients with mild symptoms and those who are on a recovery path and no longer need extensive medical support. These facilities allow the hospitals to focus resources on providing care to those who require emergency and intensive care. The Community Care Facility (CCF) is one such facility for patients with milder symptoms. At the CCFs, patients continue to be monitored and have access to appropriate medical care when needed.13.          Currently, we have more than 10,000 bed spaces in CCFs for our patients. These include places such as the D’Resort at Paris Ris, Singapore Expo Halls 1 to 6, and part of Changi Exhibition Centre. Another 10,000 are being set up. Building up our CCF capacity called for a multi-agency effort comprising government agencies and the private sector. Many teams had worked round the clock to make this possible, and I want to extend my gratitude to all of them. For example, for the first hall in EXPO, this was made possible through the hard work of individuals from Temasek Holdings, Singapore Expo, Surbana Jurong, the Integrated Health Information Systems, Resorts World Sentosa as the managing agent, PSA, ST Engineering, Certis Cisco, Parkway Pantai, the Woodlands Health Campus as well as the SAF. The list is very long, but this gives us a sense of the complexity of the operations and how closely everyone had to work together. Through the efforts of everyone involved, we managed to set up the first hall in a week. This is truly an exemplary example of a Whole-Of-Society effort.14.          We have also set up Community Recovery Facilities (CRFs), which is a step-down facility for recovering patients. Based on epidemiological evidence and research by local and international infectious disease experts, patients who remain well at day 14 of their illness are past the critical stage and are unlikely to need further medical care. However, they still have to be isolated to reduce the risk of transmission. Hence, patients past day 14 of their illness can be safely transferred to the CRFs before they are assessed for discharge. 15.          We currently have around 2,000 CRF bed spaces, with some of them within our dormitories, and others in selected SAF camps. We will be expanding CRF capacity to more than 10,000 beds by end June. As our CRF facilities increase, we can also free up spaces at the CCFs.16.          With this layered set of healthcare facilities, customised to patient needs, we will be able to provide appropriate care for patients while also ensuring sufficient healthcare capacity to meet our needs. All these efforts require close coordination among multiple agencies, as the example of CCF @ Singapore Expo illustrates, to ensure operations are optimised, facilities are well-managed, patient flows are facilitated and tracked, while keeping watch on the capacity utilisation overall.  MOH has set up a Medical Operations Task Force (MOTF) with the support of the SAF to oversee and coordinate our efforts on the ground. I want to thank our partners, and SAF in particular, for their support and efforts.17.          Looking ahead, while we take heart in the progress made, especially in the community cases, we should not be complacent. There are still unlinked cases, and cases picked up from our surveillance programme, indicating the presence of hidden cases in the community. Globally, the number of cases also continues to increase. Even countries and regions with low daily numbers, such as China, Hong Kong, South Korea and New Zealand, are watching out anxiously for a second wave of infection that may result in another prolonged outbreak.18.          Hence we must continue to do what we can to keep our cases low, to keep the lid tight even as we gradually roll back some of our circuit breaker measures. We are now at the end of the two weeks of tighter circuit breaker measures. Last Saturday, the Multi-Ministerial Taskforce announced the gradual resumption of selected activities and services in the coming weeks, subject to the necessary safe management measures being in place. The rest of the circuit breaker measures will continue to apply till 1 June. Roadmap Ahead19.          If we work together, by 1 June, we hope our situation will have improved further, with community cases remaining low or coming down further.  Migrant worker cases in the dormitories will hopefully by then be clearly under control. We can then consider further opening up. This is important to enable our people to start going back to work. It is also important for Singapore to protect our strategic position in the global supply chains as the global economy recovers from COVID-19.20.          We will still need to open up in a phased and calibrated manner, to avoid a second wave of outbreak. There will likely still be cases of infection in the community, as the virus is very difficult to eradicate. What is key is to keep the number of cases small and reduce the risk of big clusters, through various safeguards and enablers. It will take a while before the COVID-19 outbreak subsides globally, or before a vaccine is available. Thus we will have to adapt to a new way of life and social interactions. Indicators for Phased Opening21.          Ms. Sylvia Lim asked what indicators we would look at in considering lifting the circuit breaker measures. We would consider a variety of factors.22.          First, numbers are important but they are not the only thing. We need to be assured that community transmission locally is stemmed, or very low. Community cases should ideally fall to zero or single-digits daily, with very low numbers of unlinked cases, and not just for one day, but sustained over a period of time. We also need to see a decrease in migrant worker cases. These cases are high today, partly due to proactive case-finding in some settings. While we have been able to keep local community cases low despite high number of cases among migrant workers, it is equally important to reduce the migrant worker cases over time, though it will take a while longer. Otherwise we will continue to be at risk of a spillover from the dormitories into the wider population.23.          Second, we need to make an assessment of the situation globally and for individual countries, to inform the extent and approach on reopening our borders. We would review the rate of transmissions in other countries, as well as what they have done to contain the spread. For any re-opening of our borders, we are likely to start small and selectively, and to continue to impose a mix of isolation and test requirements, to protect ourselves from new imported cases leading to community spread.24.          Third, we must put in place a system to allow us to open up safely. When we allow more business and social activities to resume, there will be more interactions, and higher risk of virus transmission at the workplace and in the community. Therefore we need to step up our capability and capacity to test and detect cases early, contact trace quickly, ringfence close contacts promptly, and establish the original source of the infection to stop other undetected transmission chains if any. These are the key enablers which will give us confidence to re-open. Testing Strategy and Capacity25.          Let me start with testing as the first key enabler. To date, we have conducted over 140,000 tests for COVID-19, or 2,500 tests per hundred thousand people in Singapore.[1] This is among the highest testing rates in the world. But we plan to do more, and will continue to expand our testing capacity, and to strategically deploy them to yield the greatest impact.26.          Members have asked about different tests and their uses. Today, we use mainly the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR tests, to detect confirmed COVID-19 cases. The PCR works by detecting the virus RNA from a nose or throat swab, and is the gold standard for detecting current infection. To the question by Ms. Sylvia Lim, we use PCR testing for three key purposes – one, to diagnose suspect cases to provide early treatment and isolate close contacts; two, to do screening and active case finding of individuals at risk, such as migrant workers decanted from their dormitories before they return to work; and three, to do surveillance to monitor undetected cases in the community. Currently, we have the capacity to conduct more than 8,000 PCR tests a day in total across our community and migrant workers in the dormitories, up from 2,900 a day in early April. We are working with various private and public sector partners to progressively increase our testing capacity further to up to 40,000 a day.27.          With this increase, we will widen the net that we cast for diagnostic testing for symptomatic cases, active case finding, screening and surveillance testing in our community and among workers, including migrant workers. We will also do more testing and monitoring to pick out asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases among priority groups such as nursing home residents and staff, to prevent clusters from developing. Testing is crucial as risk of infection will increase when we allow more economic and social activities to resume.28.          Ms. Sylvia Lim and Ms. Foo Mee Har had asked about another type of test called serology testing. This works by detecting antibodies produced by the body to fight against the virus from a blood sample. Based on our local studies, the effectiveness of such tests is very low in the first 10 days of illness as it takes time for the immune system to develop antibodies. Therefore, unlike the PCR testing, serology tests are useful to indicate past infection but it is not very useful for early diagnosis because of the time lag. Many such tests in the market are also still under review and validation.29.          Notwithstanding this, NCID has begun to use serology testing to study the level of infections among various groups, including healthcare workers, close contacts of COVID-19 patients, and the general population. Their study was published last week, and found that among the close to 2,000 samples from our healthcare worker volunteers and the general population, none had antibodies pointing to a past infection. This shows that the infection rate among our healthcare workers and general population is low. The study also showed that among close contacts around 2.5% had antibodies, despite not having had symptoms during their quarantine.  That means they had been infected earlier but recovered, and remained well without any symptoms. This points to the need to continue our efforts to quickly isolate close contacts of confirmed cases. We will continue to do more of these studies, to help us understand the extent of spread and immunity in the community.  I should add that scientific evidence on protective immunity is still under intensive study currently.30.          There have been some suggestions to do asymptomatic testing for the entire population. We will study this. As there is no widespread community transmission here, the yield will be very low if asymptomatic testing is done indiscriminately for the whole population. To be effective, it may also need to be done repeatedly as it does not reflect immunity and those tested can be infected after the test.  It may not be best way to use our testing resources.31.          Instead, we will and have started doing asymptomatic testing selectively, for priority groups. For example, we currently test asymptomatic young children, if they are in the same household as COVID-19 patients, since they may not be able to articulate their symptoms well. In addition, a key priority is to protect vulnerable groups. This includes seniors, particularly nursing home residents. As mentioned, we have started to test staff and residents at MOH and MSF homes with a high proportion of seniors, such as Nursing Homes and Welfare Homes. Such tests complement existing precautionary measures, such as good infection control practices and close monitoring for symptoms in staff and residents.  They will allow us to intervene early where needed to protect the elderly residents.  As more businesses reopen, we may also do more tests for essential services workers. At our borders, we can also deploy tests for arrivals to reduce the risk of local transmission from imported cases.32.          In all, as we build up our testing capacity, we will be able to test more and for more purposes. This will be important as we start to open up, so that we can pre-emptively detect and break any potential transmission chains. Contact Tracing with Technology33.          The second enabler is our contact tracing capacity. After we have confirmed a COVID-19 case, we will need to contact trace and isolate high-risk close contacts, to limit the spread in the community. This needs to be done fast, has to be scalable and thorough to be effective. This will allow us to quickly ringfence and prevent further spread.  We have set up 50 contact tracing teams, up from 20 since my last update in March.  But we must scale up quickly if there are more cases or large clusters, and to discover less obvious links. To do so manually will be very difficult.34.          Many countries have leveraged on technology to help them contact trace effectively and efficiently. We will also explore how we can tap on SafeEntry and TraceTogether as well as other technological solutions.  Supporting Our Healthcare Workers35.          Even as we build our capability and capacity for testing, contact tracing and healthcare infrastructure, we need the support of our healthcare workers. They are at the core of our fight against this COVID-19 outbreak. We deeply appreciate their sacrifices, long hours as well as personal and professional commitment to care for each patient. This will be a long campaign, and we will need the support of our healthcare workers and we will need to support them and take care of their needs.36.          Many MPs have asked about the well-being of our healthcare workers. I would like to reaffirm our commitment to take care of them in every way. Our key priority is in keeping them safe and healthy by ensuring adequate supply of Personal Protective Equipment to protect our healthcare workers, and provide them training on the proper usage. 37.          I thank Dr Chia Shi-Lu for his concern on the infection rate among our healthcare workers. As of 26 Apr 2020, there were 66 cases of confirmed COVID-19 infection among healthcare workers. 46 cases were from healthcare workers whose work involve direct contact with patients. Based on the investigations thus far, there are no established epidemiological links of a healthcare worker being infected in the line of duty for caring for their patients, except for one case in a private healthcare institution where we are unable to rule out a possible link between the doctor and a COVID-19 patient. Our healthcare workers have taken an extra level of care at their workplaces to protect themselves and their families. The recent National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) study also did not detect any past infection among a sample of healthcare workers. Nevertheless, we cannot be complacent. We have reminded our healthcare workers constantly that they should take adequate precaution during their work to protect themselves, their patients as well as their family members. In the event that our healthcare workers fall ill, we will ensure that they are well taken care of and our healthcare institutions will provide them with the necessary support.38.          It is also important for us to take care of the mental well-being of our healthcare workers. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare clusters had measures in place, such as counselling clinics, helplines, and peer support programmes. We have since stepped up our efforts. For example, our institutions have rostered breaks and staff rotations to ensure that healthcare workers have sufficient rest periods in between work days. The clusters have also been actively working with the NTUC, and in particular the Healthcare Services Employees’ Union (HSEU), with initiatives such as the distribution of care packages, the launch of GrabCare to provide transport for our frontline workers, and collaboration with Mindfi, a mindfulness app.39.          The many gifts and words of encouragement from members of the public to our healthcare workers mean a lot to them and have helped to keep up their morale. Members of the public have been writing thank you messages and buying breakfast for our healthcare workers. As part of the SG United initiative, close to 9,000 messages for our healthcare workers were collected from Appreciation Zones across Singapore. On behalf of our healthcare workers, let me thank you for your continued support.40.          Compensation is another important area, which Ms. Cheryl Chan Wei Ling had asked about. We recognise the invaluable contributions of our workers, and will ensure that they receive due recognition for stepping up during this challenging period. DPM had previously announced a special bonus for our public healthcare workers working on the frontline. Healthcare workers are also paid shift or overtime allowances if they take on longer or more shifts during this outbreak.41.          However, we recognise that no monetary compensation is ever enough. I want to again acknowledge and thank our healthcare workers for their hard work and dedication. One great example is Ms Tovelle Loh, an assistant nurse clinician from NCID. Ms Loh supports training of staff to ensure that they are updated on infection control policies and recommendations, and also helps to review infection control workflows at NCID and other settings. Despite the heavy work load, she remains spirited and committed to do the best for her patients, and it helps that her husband has been very supportive. Examples like Ms Loh abound, among our frontline workers, support staff, and also researchers in our testing and research labs.42.          Another key part of our strategy is to augment the healthcare workforce, which Mr Murali Pillai had asked about. While our public healthcare sector currently has sufficient healthcare professionals, they are stretched, and there is a need to rotate and refresh staff periodically, as the fight against COVID-19 is likely to be a long one.43.          To address these sustainability concerns, MOH has given the public healthcare institutions some flexibility to deploy staff across institutions to meet pressing operational needs on the ground and to support one another as one public healthcare system, with strict infection control protocols in place.44.          MOH has also looked to external sources to augment our public healthcare workforce. This includes tapping on healthcare professionals in the private sector and encouraging retired and non-practising staff to return to public practice through the newly launched SG Healthcare Corps. We have expanded the scope to include those without prior healthcare experience, whom we will train to take on supporting roles, such as performing swab procedures and basic care roles. As of 3 May, we received more than 11,000 sign-ups altogether. I am heartened by this overwhelming response from Singaporeans. So far, we have matched about 800 Corps members to various needs on the ground, and they are being progressively deployed, and we will do more. Members of the SG Healthcare Corps will be remunerated for their time and contribution when they are deployed to work alongside our healthcare workers on the ground.45.          Third, we also use technology as a force multiplier, to deliver the same or enhanced outcomes, with less time and resources. For example, in the CCFs, round-the-clock care is made possible through the use of medical kiosks and teleconsultations. Devices such as pulse oximeters and health apps are also used to monitor patient well-being. Healthcare institutions have also started teleconsultation services for follow-up on their patients.46.          Through all these initiatives, we aim to ensure that our public healthcare services remain available to those in need, and our healthcare workers are well-taken care of during this challenging period. This enables us to have a sustainable healthcare workforce in this long-term fight. Health Promotion47.          Even as we fight COVID-19, we need to continue to address longer-term health issues. I am glad that Prof Lim Sun Sun has asked about this. Let me share what we have been doing in this area.48.          We have temporarily deferred launching any new initiatives to allow staff to be re-deployed to more critical areas of COVID-19 work. But for selected programmes, such as measures on sugar sweetened beverages, banning partially-hydrogenated oils, and standardised packaging for tobacco products, we will continue to push ahead.49.          To support our safe distancing measures, we have already suspended all on-ground activities such as general health screening, but we will continue to encourage Singapore residents to practise healthy habits and fight diabetes through less resource-intensive alternative platforms. For example, the Health Promotion Board (HPB) continues to provide on HealthHub bite-sized videos and articles on practising good personal hygiene, healthy eating, physical activity, and mental well-being. 50.          We must also never let our guard down on dengue. The total number of dengue cases in 2020 has exceeded 6,000 – more than double that over the same period in 2019.  With the traditional dengue peak season approaching, National Environment Agency (NEA) officers are on the ground conducting dengue inspections at common areas and construction sites, where construction site operators continue to be responsible for vector control measures, even during the circuit breaker period.  A worrying trend that NEA observed was a 50 per cent increase in Aedes mosquito breeding in homes over the past three years, compared to the preceding three years. Minister Masagos has asked me to urge everyone at home to be vigilant and do the Mozzie Wipeout to remove potential mosquito breeding habitats. NEA also brought forward the National Dengue Prevention campaign to 22 March to rally all members of the community. Our efforts on all these fronts continue even as we battle the COVID-19 outbreak, to keep Singaporeans healthy. Conclusion51.          Let me conclude. In this fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone can play a role, during and after the circuit breaker period.52.          We acknowledge that the circuit breaker measures are difficult, and we appreciate everyone’s support and sacrifice to stay home and adhere to the measures. For our frontline officers, including those in healthcare, and dormitories operations, we stand behind you, and want to express our enormous gratitude to your efforts. Our collective efforts are not in vain, and we have seen a decrease in our community numbers.53.          We are looking ahead, and making preparations for post-1 June. We must make calibrated moves to prevent a resurgence of cases and clusters.  We must put in place key enablers and safeguards to allow us to contain the spread and care for future cases, even as we roll back our circuit breaker measures and re-open.54.          We must remain vigilant and must not let our guards down. If we all do our part, we can overcome and emerge stronger. Let us work together, and move forward together, as one SG United. [1] As of 27 Apr 2020.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/ministerial-statement-by-mr-gan-kim-yong-minister-for-health-at-parliament-on-the-second-update-on-whole-of-government-response-to-covid-19-4-may-2020

The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Health Promotion Board (HPB) have been working with community partners and healthcare clusters to raise awareness on falls prevention through public education, exercise programmes and campaigns. Let me cite a few examples.2        Under the National Seniors’ Health Programme, regular health talks and workshops are conducted at various community touchpoints to educate seniors on falls prevention. Over 6,000 seniors have attended these health talks across the past year, acquiring tips such as removing clutter in the home to pre-empt the risks of falls. Seniors on long-term medication for several medical conditions are also advised to consult a doctor for a medication review at least once a year, as a possible side effect of taking multiple medications concurrently includes dizziness. 3        Seniors are encouraged to exercise regularly, and to do strength, balance and flexibility exercises at least twice a week. This helps to delay age-related loss of muscle mass and strength, which reduces the risk for falls. The HPB holds weekly senior exercise classes in more than 600 community spaces island-wide and more than 50,000 seniors attended these classes in 2019.4        The HPB also piloted ‘Rolling Good Times’ in 2018, a programme to raise awareness of common falls situations, improve seniors’ strength and balance through exercises, and teach them how to minimise the risk of injuries during a fall. To date, some 160 seniors have participated in the pilot programme, and most have shown improvement in their strength, balance and flexibility.  Hence, HPB intends to reach out to more seniors by progressively rolling out the programme to more community nodes nationwide.5        Targeting pre-frail and frail seniors, the Healthy Ageing Promotion Programme For You (HAPPY) programme implemented by the National University Health System engages seniors in exercises combined with cognitive activities. Such dual-task exercises have been shown to stimulate cognitive functions and improve physical ability, preventing dementia and frailty as well as reducing one’s risk for falls. More than 700 seniors have participated in HAPPY as of January 2020.  6        Although senior-centric activities have been temporarily suspended since March 2020 due to COVID-19, many organisations have since adapted most of their activities and classes to online content so that our seniors can continue to stay active and engaged while at home.7        Lastly, HPB had organised Falls Prevention Awareness campaigns in 2016 and 2017 to provide seniors and their caregivers with information on how to reduce the risk of falls. As part of the campaigns, educational videos and guidebooks were produced for seniors and their caregivers. These resources remain available online.8        MOH and the healthcare family will continue to strengthen our efforts to reduce the risk for falls among our senior population.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/seniors-and-falls

Good safe management measures like telecommuting, avoiding face-to-face meetings, and regular disinfection of common touch points and equipment should continue. At work premises, workers should avoid all social interactions with their colleagues, including during meals and break times. Everyone must wear masks when outside of the home. Basic hygiene practices such as staying home when unwell, and practising good hand and personal hygiene must continue.4.             In line with these, the Ministry of Manpower and other relevant agencies will be issuing more details on the safe management measures which employers are required to implement in various workplace settings, including offices, common meeting and rest areas, factories, customer-facing settings and transportation.Implementation of SafeEntry5.             Alongside measures to reduce the risk of transmission in daily interactions and activities, we need to continue to strengthen our contact tracing regime through the use of technology.  6.             As announced previously, businesses and services that are in operation must come on board SafeEntry to log the check-in of employees and visitors. As a start, deployment will be made mandatory for places where individuals are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods or in enclosed spaces, or where there is higher traffic. To date, SafeEntry has been deployed at over 16,000 premises. The list of facilities/places where SafeEntry must be deployed from 12 May 2020 is found in the Annex. This list will be updated at https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/deployment as more activities and services resume.   7.             Employees and visitors should check-in and check-out of workplaces and other venues using SafeEntry to help our contact tracers establish cluster links and transmission chains. It is important that everyone plays their part and uses SafeEntry, so that we can collectively prevent new clusters from forming.  Social Responsibility is Key8.             Social responsibility is critical in slowing the spread of COVID-19. Even as the circuit breaker measures are gradually eased, all of us should continue to stay at home as much as possible, and minimise movement outside the home. Individuals should adopt good practices and abide by safe distancing measures, and businesses should put in place safe management measures, so that we can resume activities safely and gradually as we exit the circuit breaker period.  MINISTRY OF HEALTHSMART NATION AND DIGITAL GOVERNMENT OFFICE",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/implementing-safeentry-and-safe-management-practices

This was based on the erroneous test results submitted by the laboratory. Due to a human error, the laboratory had mislabelled a swab sample from a COVID-19 positive individual as belonging to Case 45655 without properly verifying the patient identifiers of the specimen tubes. Consequently, Case 45655 was recorded as being positive for COVID-19, and was reported to MOH as such. 3.  The error was discovered upon re-testing of Case 45655 and MOH was informed of the error on 13 July. The mislabelled positive sample belongs to a migrant worker who had been isolated since his swab, and had not been in contact with any other individuals. He is currently well.4.    Further testing of the correct sample and new swab samples from the student all produced negative results for COVID-19. The test results for the close contacts who had been placed on quarantine following the first confirmed case at the school (Case 45160) have all tested negative for COVID-19 as well. This means there is no transmission at the school. 5.    The student had so far been isolated and had not come into contact with any other COVID-19 patients and is therefore not at risk of infection from other patients in the hospital. MOH has informed the Ministry of Education, and rescinded the Quarantine Orders of the close contacts who had previously been placed on quarantine. 6.    MOH takes a serious view of this error. We are investigating this matter, and will take appropriate actions against the laboratory if it is found to be in breach of protocols. In the meantime, the laboratory has reviewed and tightened its processes to prevent a recurrence of the error. MINISTRY OF HEALTH14 JULY 2020",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/mis-reported-covid-19-case-due-to-laboratory-error

We are in the final stretch of dormitory clearances, which will allow the vast majority of workers to resume work by mid to late August 2020. As we gradually open our borders, we are adjusting our charging policy for COVID-19 treatment to support returning travellers should they be infected while participating in permitted essential travel. While more activities and events are allowed to resume over time, most events should remain fully virtual or hybrid physical-virtual where possible to protect our loved ones and fellow Singaporeans. Progress of Dormitory Clearance2.     The Inter-agency Taskforce will complete the testing of all workers in the dormitories by 7 August 2020. This means that all the dormitories will be COVID-cleared, with the exception of several standalone blocks which serve as quarantine facilities.3.      The workers in these quarantine facilities will be tested when their isolation ends, and case counts will remain high. After completing their isolation, most of the workers will be able to resume work once the dormitory operators and employers complete the necessary preparations to do so in a safe manner.  Expediting the Return of Workers to Work4.      Government agencies are also working closely with the employers to ensure that their workers practise safe living and safe distancing measures at sites and dormitories.  With the completion of dormitory clearance and facilitation of resumption of work by sector agencies, we expect the vast majority of dormitory residents to be able to resume work by mid to late August (i.e. have AccessCode green).Revised Charging Policy for COVID-19 Treatment for Travellers 5.     The Government has been bearing the costs of inpatient medical bills for Singapore Citizens (SCs)/ Permanent Residents (PRs)/ Long-Term Pass Holders (LTPHs) who require treatment for COVID-19 at public healthcare institutions (PHIs). This does not apply to individuals who breach travel advisories. SCs/ PRs/ LTPHs who travel overseas from 27 Mar 2020 onwards are required to pay for their own inpatient medical bills in full should they have onset of symptoms within 14 days of returning to Singapore. They will also not be able to claim from MediShield Life or Integrated Shield Plans in public and private hospitals, should they require COVID-19 inpatient care.6.     The Government is gradually permitting essential travel through various travel arrangements. From 7 August 2020, all outbound SCs/ PRs/ LTPHs travellers who travel abroad under permitted travel arrangements will be able to tap on regular healthcare financing arrangements for their inpatient medical bills, should they have onset of symptoms within 14 days of their return to Singapore and require hospital admission for suspected COVID-19 infection. In other words, SCs/PRs will be eligible for Government subsidies and MediShield Life/ Integrated Shield Plans coverage, and will be required to pay any remaining co-payment. LTPHs may tap on their prevailing financing arrangements (e.g. foreign worker insurance), where applicable. 7.     The permitted travel arrangements to which the above applies include Green/ Fast Lanes which are currently in place, as well as any permitted travel arrangement that may be implemented in the future.    8.     SCs/ PRs/ LTPHs who are not under permitted travel arrangements and travel in breach of the travel advisories will continue to pay for their COVID-19 inpatient medical bills in full with no access to subsidies and MediShield Life/ Integrated Shield Plan coverage. 9.   Short-Term Pass Holders entering Singapore under permitted travel arrangements will remain responsible for their medical bills, should they test positive for COVID-19.Gradual Resumption of Activities; Most Events to Remain Virtual 10.      On 4 August 2020, we launched a pilot for wedding receptions of up to 50 persons. The list of places where wedding receptions can be held is being gradually expanded to include more venues. For now, wedding receptions are allowed only in controlled venues where safe management measures can be better implemented and enforced, such as restaurants, hotels, and public and private function rooms. For example, selected indoor function spaces managed by NParks have been available for wedding receptions since 4 August 2020 while function rooms and multi-purpose halls at community centres/clubs will be available from 31 August 2020. 11.     In order to reduce our total risk exposure, most other events should continue to remain virtual for now. These include large gatherings and festivities surrounding national and community occasions such as National Day (e.g. community concerts and observance ceremonies) and Seventh Lunar Month events (e.g. live auctions, getai performances). 12.       Seventh Lunar Month prayers and post-funeral religious rites conducted by religious organisations with a good track record of implementing safe management measures, or by religious workers endorsed by these religious organisations, will be allowed to take place in places of worship and some external venues such as HDB common areas. The Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth will release details shortly. Taking Steady Steps Towards the New Normal 13.       The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to monitor the situation closely as we take steady steps towards a new normal. Social responsibility remains key, and we will need to work and innovate together so that we can achieve a new COVID-19 normal where we can resume most activities and events safely. MINISTRY OF HEALTH6 AUGUST 2020",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/final-stretch-of-dormitory-clearance-further-steps-towards-a-new-covid-normal

We are not able to meet in large groups to commemorate this day because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but many are holding virtual celebrations and posting their wishes and aspirations for Singapore online. Throughout this weekend, NDP2020 will be brought into every Singaporean’s home. Our National Day celebrations, while reduced in physical scale, are not any less meaningful than before.2.            This morning, for example, we will sing the National Anthem together across different parts of the island. This is particularly meaningful for us at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID). It is a recognition of the role healthcare family plays, especially in our fight against COVID-19. Indeed, healthcare and health have always been key pillars of our society’s progress. But in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the contributions of our healthcare workers and healthcare institutions, not just in NCID, but all over Singapore and in all healthcare institutions, are even more pertinent.3.            It has been more than six months since our first COVID-19 patients emerged. Today the pandemic still shows no sign of abating globally. Our healthcare workers have faced tremendous challenges and made many personal sacrifices over these months. Yet you have persevered in playing your part at the frontline of Singapore’s fight against COVID-19. I want to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you for your dedication, courage and resilience.4.            The COVID-19 pandemic has also impacted economies around the world. Singapore is not insulated from this impact. The lives and livelihoods of many Singaporeans have been affected, and the road to recovery will be long and tough. But I am confident the COVID-19 virus will not break our Singapore spirit of grit, resilience, determination and unity.5.            The theme of this year’s National Day is “Together, a stronger Singapore”. As we sing our National Anthem in our heart later, let us unite as one people. Let us renew our pledge to stay resolute and press on together to overcome obstacles and build a brighter future for Singapore. Just as we have triumphed over past adversities, we will similarly emerge stronger from this crisis, because we are Singapore, and we are Singaporeans.6.            Happy National Day!",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/remarks-by-mr-gan-kim-yong-minister-for-health-at-the-national-day-anthem-moment-at-national-centre-for-infectious-diseases-9-august-2020-9.45am

A lot has been said about the unprecedented nature of COVID-19. Indeed, there are potentially many silver linings. I would imagine, if you had suggested a team of five or six people could organise a conference for 4,000 people from around the world and make it available for free - with a distinguished list of panelists and speakers and experts from around the world joining - if you had put that idea out a year or two ago, I don’t know if you would have persuaded many people of your ability. But now, this also like many other things has become possible. 2          Nevertheless, organising a conference about an issue like this requires many partners. It is a testament to both the complexity of this issue, as well as the willingness by stakeholders to get engaged, that we can have a conference like this, organised by Brahm Centre, National University of Singapore, Institute of Mental Health, Agency for Integrated Care, National Council of Social Services, National Healthcare Group, and SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre. Many people, coming together in this space to contribute. This breadth of partnership tells us about the importance of this issue, but also how it affects many different layers of our community, and many different aspects and facets. The Impact of COVID-19 on mental health 3          The COVID-19 pandemic has not just been all about silver linings and transformations, from telecommuting, to safe distancing, to organising conferences. It has also generated quite a lot of uncertainty. The primary uncertainty that we are grappling with every day is how long this will go on. We can remember when things were quite different, but we do not know when we are going to change from today’s experiences. It is possible that this new normal may have to be the watermark for some time, and we may have to find a way to adapt, to adjust the way we live, work and play, and adapt on the basis that we are in this, certainly for some time, and we will need to reduce the risk of spreading the virus and keep ourselves and our loved ones safe. Not for a month or two of a circuit breaker, but potentially for a year or two. The uncertainty of time, the uncertainty of measures, as well as the uncertainty of the effectiveness of measures have resulted in stressors impacting our mental wellbeing. National Care Hotline 4          This will affect us as individuals, as a community, and test our resilience, our cohesion, our sense of peacefulness. We recognise this. The  Ministry of Health (MOH), government agencies, and most importantly our community partners have been working on this for some time, prior to the start of COVID-19. Not because we knew that a pandemic was coming along, but we knew there would be tests such as this, and we would need to enable many people to work together - a community of practice and a community of care to drive mental health. We launched the Community Mental Health Masterplan in 2017, increasing outreach, developing early detection processes, providing care and support to those living with mental health conditions in the community, and a number of initiatives have been rolled out  and I think we have made some good progress. 5          The Agency of Integrated Care (AIC) has set up a network of 43 community outreach teams and trained over 24,000 frontline staff, recognising that this is not something just for people in specialist and niche roles, but really all frontline staff across government agencies and community partners, will need some confidence in identifying persons with mental health needs in the community so that we can refer them to appropriate support. And as of last year, we have reached out to over 300,000 persons as a result. 6          Not all of them needed specialised care and not all of them needed particular intervention. For example more than 23,000 of them were at risk of developing mental health conditions or dementia, and needed some form of specialist intervention. Those partners who are themselves, specialist practitioners or general practitioners for example, may not have the confidence or experience necessarily in this particular area, and they too, need to be provided the skills and confidence to diagnose and support persons with mental health conditions in the community. We have been working with partners to train General Practitioners, and even as we want to reinforce the idea of community response, there are individuals who will need medicalised response. But we want for that more and more to happen within the community. 7          We’ve got the National CARE Hotline, so that individuals have direct access to discuss their concerns  and anxiety and adjustment issues. And we have had 900 counsellors, psychiatrists, social workers and public officers stepping forward to volunteer to man the hotline. It has handled about  28,000 calls and about 12,000 of these calls have been channeled to the trained volunteers to administer psychological first aid. Essentially, counselling care and support, helping to deal with mental resilience, helping to deal with stressors.  This adaptation is the new normal. We keep using the word. In a way, it is a recognition that what we are all going through is entirely natural and expected given the circumstances. It would be abnormal not to feel stress and anxiety, given what we are going through. It would be abnormal to be blasé and pretend that there is an impact on each of us personally or on our relationships. SG UNited EFFORTS 8          But it is not entirely a given that we would come together as a community, that we would come together and help one another. This is something that we should be thankful for, and this is something we should help drive and support. Other partners such as the Ministry of Culture, Community & Youth and the Health Promotion Board are working through the SG United effort, trying to drive and develop the idea that we can  all extend our support and concern for people around us. And community groups can and have stepped up to do more for those who are affected by COVID-19. Our community mental health partners have provided mental health promotion services and conducted urgent home visits for vulnerable clients. Everybody can come together and help us adjust together to this new normal, and to the stressors and anxieties that we all face. 9          There are some good examples out there. There are community partners who are doing things which we can all learn from, and hopefully more of us can get involved. For example, Silver Ribbon (Singapore) and Fei Yue are providing video and online counselling services, while Montfort Care Singapore runs daily shows teaching preventive health exercises on their Facebook page. The Alzheimer’s Disease Association (ADA) running weekly online Zoom activities such as art and craft, bingo, cooking and karaoke. And collaborations from ADA, AIC, Singapore Police Force and Singapore Food Agency on an initiative known as SPOC-19, or ‘Support for Persons living with dementia, to offer assistance to persons living with dementia and their caregivers, and recognising that this group is vulnerable not just from their condition, but also from their ability to comply  to COVID-19 safety measures, and how do we help them to become increasingly integrated and comfortable with members of the community. 10        Employers have played their part, putting in place mental wellness programs such as talks and counselling services. But most importantly, awareness to help their staff tide through this difficult period of adjusting to the new normal of working from home and workplace safe management measures, and proactively trying to build that resilience and strength to adapt. 11        This pandemic, like many crises, has demonstrated that we need a whole of society approach, to shift mindsets, to build emotional and mental resilience, to adapt and to bring our society together. The event theme this year, Enhancing Resilience & Performance, aims to engage the participants with a focus on the present, shifting our mindsets and responding mindfully to changes, to empower ourselves to lead happier and healthier lives. It is timely and appropriate, and something we can all engage with productively. I am very grateful and heartened to know that  social service agencies like the  Brahm Centre have continued to provide their services and programmes, such as free health talks and exercise, art therapy, mindfulness and meditation classes, adapting your services to the platforms and the times, to provide them virtually to those who need them. CLOSING 12        To conclude, I would like to thank our mental health partners such as Brahm Centre for their ongoing huge  support in promoting overall health and wellbeing through a holistic approach, especially during this testing period. I hope that through this conference, we can share best practices and learn each other’s best practices together in developing better communities that can help us weather this storm. 13        Please continue to stay safe, stay strong, and I hope you have a fruitful and fulfilling time at the conference.

Just about a year ago, I was at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID), congratulating the team on the opening of NCID. At that time I had highlighted that the threat of infectious disease outbreaks was ever present, and that we should remain ever vigilant. We should always be in a state of preparedness and be ready to respond to emerging public health threats. This would not only involve the strengthening of our clinical and public health capabilities, but also forging strong partnerships with other key players.2.            No one would have expected then that we will be put to the test so quickly and be placed in the forefront of what the Prime Minister had termed as the “crisis of a generation”. I must say that I am very encouraged that NCID and our whole healthcare system has stood up to the challenge. Today, let me thank everyone in NCID for helping to keep Singapore safe and for caring for our patients in the past year. Thank you indeed for your hard work. Clinical and Public Health Capabilities Working in Concert3.            From the lessons learnt during SARS, we had decided to set up NCID to strengthen our capabilities in infectious disease prevention and management, as well as public health preparedness at the national level. The integration of clinical, research and public health functions under NCID will allow us to respond swiftly and effectively to events and outbreaks in a proactive and coordinated manner.4.            Throughout COVID-19, we had observed the different capabilities at NCID and the public hospitals. Let me share some examples. The National Public Health Laboratory was swift in coming out with a PCR assay to test for the new virus, and ramped up capacity to support the rapidly rising testing demand. They then supported public health investigations through virus isolation and whole genome sequencing. The National Public Health and Epidemiology Unit supported the establishment of protocols to stratify patients to appropriate levels of clinical care. The NCID operations team rapidly stood up the NCID screening centre, and expanded the capacity of the isolation beds, while the clinical team from NCID and Tan Tock Seng Hospital worked together to manage the patients at NCID.5.            The appearance of the physical building of NCID may look calm and serene, but much hard work, anxieties, and dedication have gone in to ensure that the patients are attended to in a timely and appropriate manner. It is no mean feat for NCID to be in the focus of the COVID-19 pandemic and to keep mortality low. You have done well and you should be proud of yourselves. Cooperation and Collaboration6.            I want to especially thank the very strong support of Tan Tock Seng Hospital in providing manpower and the various resources to ensure that NCID’s operations are smooth and responsive. The public healthcare family had also responded to NCID’s urgent call for resources and manpower, despite having operational and manpower challenges of their own. I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the hospitals and the teams who had come forward to assist with the COVID-19 response.7.            This crisis demonstrates that no single healthcare institution can manage a pandemic like this on its own.  Let me share a few examples of these collaborative efforts. The National COVID-19 Therapeutic Workgroup, comprising multi-disciplinary members from different institutions, was formed to discuss clinical care protocols, and evaluate the use of antiviral drugs and novel therapeutics in the treatment of COVID-19 patients. The National ICU Committee, comprising experts from NCID, public and private sector, was formed to work with MOH in the building up of surge capacity and capabilities in managing COVID-19 patients requiring ICU care. These strong collaborations across the healthcare family enable our system to be prepared and to avoid being overwhelmed like in many countries, and ensures that our patients are provided with the best care. Other Public Health Efforts in NCID8.            Although much of our effort this year had been on COVID-19, the challenges of other infectious diseases still need to be addressed. I would like to recognise the good work that has been done in NCID to strengthen our overall public health capabilities, including our National HIV Programme, the National Tuberculosis Programme, as well as coordinating the national effort to address antimicrobial resistance. Even as teams in these areas are called upon to assist with COVID-19 work, they had continued to make progress in the respective public health areas. I trust that when their day comes, and I hope not too soon, our colleagues will also readily go to their aid. Closing9.            COVID-19 is likely to remain with us for a while, but from what NCID and the healthcare family had demonstrated in the past year, I am confident that we will be able to meet the challenge of the day, and overcome this crisis of a generation. I would once again like to show my appreciation to all for the professionalism and hard work in safeguarding our nation and our people.10.          Thank you and congratulations.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-gan-kim-yong-minister-for-health-at-the-national-centre-for-infectious-diseases-first-year-anniversary-virtual-event-7-september-20-11-30am

Over a period of four weeks from 25 September 2020, MOM and MOH will be piloting an additional round of testing, on top of the existing 14 day RRT cycle for residents in the dormitory. This will effectively increase the testing frequency to a 7 day cycle. New infections can then be detected earlier, and the spread contained more quickly.3          To minimise the impact on the work schedule of the migrant workers, the pilot will be conducted within the dormitory.

On the other hand, it is also not sustainable to maintain tight restrictions for a prolonged period of time which will severely impact not only our economy but also our lives.  Therefore, we have taken a carefully calibrated approach in opening up our society and economy as we work towards Phase Three.  This is complemented by close monitoring, extensive testing and comprehensive contact tracing to keep the situation under control, as we balance the protection of lives and livelihoods. 3.           We have made significant moves towards restoring economic and social activities.  From 28 September 2020, we allowed more employees who have been working from home to return to their workplaces, which Mr Louis Chua had asked about.  However, we need to continue to keep our workplaces safe and minimise crowding.  Therefore, such employees should still continue to work from home for at least half their working time and there should be no more than 50% of such employees at the workplace at any point in time.  Work-related events, including conferences, seminars, and meetings, have also been allowed to resume, albeit within a 50-person cap for these activities to reduce the risk of transmission.  Other safe management measures should continue to be observed at work places. 4.           We have also taken steps to support the resumption of a few very targeted and specific areas.  We recognise the importance of key life events such as weddings, and the importance of religious activities and worship to our spiritual needs.  Therefore, we have allowed greater numbers of up to 100 persons to attend each of these events, in multiple zones or time slots of at most 50 persons each to limit potential risk exposure.  Earlier, we had also allowed the resumption of physical exercise classes in common community spaces, and allowed an increase in capacity for cinemas and leisure attractions such as the Zoo and Bird Park. Museums and libraries have also re-opened.  We are piloting live performances to prepare us to eventually be able to resume such activities safely.  5.           Ms Jessica Tan has asked what can be expected on further easing of measures going forward, and when this can be done, and I understand Ms Foo Mee Har would like to know whether the social and dining group size limit of five persons will be reviewed. All these are very important questions that we ask ourselves constantly.  Sir, if all of us continue to work together and keep our guard up even as more activities resume, we will be able to keep the pandemic under control, and progress towards further opening up our economy and society steadily.  For instance, we could consider allowing for general group sizes larger than five, so that larger families or groups of friends could meet and have meals together.  We are particularly concerned about dining as we need to remove our masks so as to eat and drink, but we tend to also talk at the same time.  The risk is considerably higher than activities which we can keep our masks on and maintain a safe distance.6.           We have begun pilots of events and activities with a larger number of attendees, such as trade exhibitions, conferences and religious worship to assess whether we can maintain effective precautions and safe distancing measures.  If these pilots are successful, we will be able to use the lessons learnt to allow more large-scale events to proceed.  We will also continue to facilitate further opening up for overseas travel in a safe and calibrated manner, which Minister Ong Ye Kung will talk about later in greater detail. 7.           The low number of community cases currently is not accidental but has come about due to our collective hard work and sacrifices.  Even as we move towards Phase Three, the new normal will be different from what we were used to in the pre-COVID days.  The MTF is working on a road map towards Phase 3, and we will share more details when we are ready in the coming weeks.8.           As overseas travel restrictions are progressively eased and more activities resume, it has become even more critical that each of us plays our part to exercise social responsibility and adhere to the safe management measures, in order to keep our family and friends safe as we progress towards Phase 3.

It is a pleasure to join you at this year’s edition of the Community Care Manpower Development Awards (CCMDA) and for the very first time, we are doing it via a virtual way. So, pandemic or not, it is not going to stop us from recognising the efforts that all of you have put in and also, to encourage you to pursue a career in the sector.2.      First, I would like to congratulate our award recipients. By taking this step to develop your career in the community care sector, you will now join the ranks of more than 380 community care staff who have tapped on this CCMDA to upskill themselves since it was introduced in 2017. Many of our past awardees have benefitted from the training to advance their careers and importantly, to return to contribute meaningfully to the community in ways that can help to our seniors to age better. And I hope that you will do so too.3.      The awards would not have been possible without the support of employers who are committed to developing a workforce,  possessing the right set of skills that can keep up with the growing care needs in our community, and importantly, to invest in their employees. So I would like to also take this chance to thank many of our community care organisations for actually remaining steadfast in this commitment, especially amidst the COVID-19 challenges where we have to take additional precautionary measures to protect our seniors.Appreciating our Community Care Workers4.      You have heard many people call COVID-19 the crisis of our generation and it has actually reshaped how we lead our lives and how we deliver care in the community. Since late January this year, our community care workers have gone above and beyond to support the nation’s fight against COVID-19. From stepping up on infection control to revamping the operational workflows so that safe distancing measures are in place, your contributions have ensured that aged care services in our community remain undisrupted and safe for many of our vulnerable seniors. Thank you very much for this effort. I would like to take this opportunity to also officially thank all our community care workers for your resilience and versatility in the face of COVID-19 challenges.Growing Community Care Capabilities for Tomorrow5.      Now, even as we adjust to new norms that are brought about by the pandemic, we must continue to grow our community care capabilities for the future. In fact, by 2030, one in four Singaporeans will be aged 65 and above, and many more will also be living with chronic illnesses. And the truth is that all of us, will get to the age range someday. And as our population ages, we need to put in place a robust and comprehensive community care system that not only cares for the seniors who are frail, but also keeps those who are healthy meaningfully engaged. This means that the delivery of community care services will have to go beyond just addressing an individual’s health condition, and tackle aspects like social and psychological well-being. It has to be much more holistic, taking the person as a whole. To attract and retain a robust workforce that can meet the future needs of our population, we will need to redesign job roles, reinforce learning, and provide opportunities for our community care workers to grow in their careers.Redesigning Jobs to Deliver Holistic Care6.      I will first touch on the redesigning of job roles. A rapidly evolving community care sector will need to be anchored by a committed and competent workforce. We aim to transform job roles to equip our community care workers with the skills to deliver good quality care, as well as to provide a fulfilling and meaningful career for all of you. So this year, the AIC, Ministry of Health (MOH), Public Service Division, Workforce Singapore, and several community care organisations have embarked on a pilot to redesign support care job functions within this sector. This is good news for many of you performing these roles in this sector. The goal is to create an enhanced job role that blends the different support care functions to encourage the cross-deployment and multi-skilling of staff. Through this job redesign effort, we hope that our support care workforce will be equipped with a broad range of skills that enables them to deliver better and more holistic care, as well as increase their opportunities for career progression to managerial roles within their teams. So I am excited to see how this initiative will shape our community care workforce, and to help us achieve better health, better care, and better life for Singaporeans.Reinforcing Learning to Encourage Skills Upgrading7.      Next is reinforcing learning. In a time of change, the community care workforce needs to be future-ready. Every community care staff will need to be open to continuous learning and skills-upgrading so that you can remain equipped with the relevant care skills for our seniors. Our people that we care for, expect us to be at the top of our game, to always be ready to deliver the best care. While the CCMDA supports recipients in the pursuit of educational training, there remains a need to promote skills upgrading in the workplace as well. So I am pleased to also share that the AIC will appoint two additional Learning Institutes (LIs), namely, Alzheimer’s Disease Association and Tan Tock Seng Hospital, to the AIC Learning Network from January 2021. This will bring the total number of LIs to eight, and provide about 11,000 training places yearly for the next four years. Now that we have about 20% more spaces, I hope that community care employers and the staff alike will seize this opportunity for further skills development.8.      Let me share with you one inspiring example. Mr Dennis Oen, a programme manager at Thye Hua Kwan Moral Charities, is an avid believer of life-long learning. He was a former operations manager at his family business, Dennis made a mid-career switch into the community care sector in 2018. He is currently a part of the Interim Caregiver Services team, where he reviews the nursing and caregiving needs of seniors who are about to be discharged from hospitals to facilitate their smooth transitions back home. Dennis has been keen in upgrading himself professionally to better support seniors, and so he took up a course on providing service excellence in healthcare under our AIC Learning Network in the same year that he joined the sector. Dennis has since gone on to pursue a part-time Master’s programme in Gerontology at the Singapore University of Social Sciences under the CCMDA ambit, and hopes that his newly-acquired knowledge and skills can help him develop services and programmes that can better suit the needs of our seniors. So, congratulations Dennis, and may you continue to be a role model for all your peers in the area of life-long learning.Providing Opportunities for Singaporeans to Grow in their Careers  9.      Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the community care sector needs to provide opportunities for Singaporeans to grow in their careers. Over the past years, MOH has been working with AIC to attract and groom young talents for the community care sector. I would like to share the story of Mr Khairul Rusyaidie, a recipient of this year’s CCMDA who is a therapy assistant at Vanguard Healthcare’s Woodlands Care Home. Inspired by a therapist who helped his grandmother regain her ability to walk after an extended period of severe osteoarthritis, Khairul entered the community care sector to fulfil his aspiration of making a difference in the lives of seniors. He is currently pursuing a Work-Study Diploma in Rehabilitation Care at the Institute of Technical Education, and is able to apply his knowledge that he learnt from the classroom training into the rehab sessions where he assists physiotherapists conducting exercises for seniors at Woodlands Care Home. I understand that beyond the Work-Study Diploma, Khairul hopes to further his studies, to achieve his aspiration of being a full-fledged physiotherapist. Khairul, your motivation and your drive to better the lives of our seniors is remarkable, and I wish you all the very best in your endeavours and I hope that you will also be an inspiration to many of the people in the community care sector, looking at advancing and upgrading themselves.Closing10.     Our community care staff are at the heart of our efforts to redesign jobs, to reinforce learning, and to provide opportunities to grow in their careers. As the community care sector transforms, I want to encourage all of us here to continue to learn, and muster the courage to step aside and move outside of your comfort zone so that you can keep pace with a rapidly evolving community care landscape and continue to deliver good care to our seniors. 11.     With that, congratulations once again to all our award recipients, and I wish you the very best in your journey to make a difference in the lives of many more in our community. Thank you very much and congratulations.",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-dr-koh-poh-koon-senior-minister-of-state-ministry-of-health-at-the-community-care-manpower-development-awards-ceremony-on-friday-16-october-2020-10.00am

SGP,Asia,Singapore,21/10/2020,57933,12,6.286,28,0,0,10622.891,2.2,1.153,"Speech by Dr Koh Poh Koon, Senior Minister of State, Ministry of Health, At the Virtual 35th Asean Roundtable, 21 October 2020","Ladies and Gentlemen, a very good morning to everyone.          The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every country and region in the world; inflicting significant damage on the health, economic, and social fabrics of our nations. Since the start of the outbreak early this year, COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the world, and more than 39 million cases and 1 million deaths have been reported[1] globally. While ASEAN countries were one of the first to be affected by the coronavirus, most of our Governments have acted swiftly to contain and control the outbreak. At the regional level, ASEAN is prepared through the various mechanisms that were established before the pandemic. Notwithstanding this, ASEAN countries could not escape the health, social and economic impact from COVID-19.  Let me talk about the impact of COVID-19 on our healthcare systems.2.      The most immediate impact was felt first and foremost by our healthcare systems. When case numbers rose, many hospitals in the region were placed under unprecedented stress, and healthcare providers on the frontline, were put at the vulnerable frontline of battling the coronavirus in order to save lives. An overburdened healthcare system will inevitably lead to patients succumbing to the disease. COVID-19 has therefore demonstrated the critical importance of investing in health security and strengthening of healthcare systems. We also needed to be agile to adapt our healthcare policies, infrastructure and systems quickly in this changing situation. 3.      In Singapore, to ensure sufficient hospital capacity to care for COVID-19 patients, our public hospitals postponed non-urgent elective procedures, discharged medically stable long-stayers to step-down facilities, as well as repurposed and converted existing wards into isolation rooms. A close public-private partnership has also enabled us to quickly expand our medical capacity by setting up community care facilities to care for patients with mild symptoms or those who are on a recovery path and no longer require extensive medical support. In this way, we were able to deploy our medical resources optimally to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed.  4.        Many ASEAN countries have faced similar challenges. COVID-19 had therefore underscored the importance of strengthening health systems and accelerating progress towards universal health coverage. We should reframe the way we think about spending on health – not just as costs, but as investments. Investment in the health of our people, our society, and our economy. Establishing a strong and resilient health system with an emphasis on strengthening public health capabilities can help countries meet the challenges of health security risks and enhance preparedness of the region towards future public health emergencies. Pandemics may actually happen more frequently and one more devastating than COVID-19 is a genuine possibility. Let me next talk about the impact of COVID-19 on our economy and society.5.        COVID-19 is more than just a public health crisis. To contain the spread of COVID-19, countries started going into lockdowns and enacted temporary restrictions on cross-border travel and movement. As a result, there were severe disruptions to global economic activity which has led to both demand- and supply-side shocks to the ASEAN economy. Its impact has been broad and significant, affecting different sectors of the economy to varying degrees. Notably, the air transport and tourism sectors have been the hardest hit. 6.     Countries also bear economic losses unevenly. For example, supply chain disruptions due to lockdowns and quarantine measures affect countries that are dependent on merchandise trade, such as Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia and Thailand. Travel bans and temporary closure of public spaces have weighed on services, especially tourism. Meanwhile, measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 have affected the labour market, and unemployment rates are expected to rise as a result. Given the situation, it is almost certain that the regional economy will face a recession this year. 7.      The economic impacts and effects of COVID-19 have caused devastating impacts on businesses and livelihoods. As such, many Governments have rolled out policies and fiscal stimulus packages to cushion the shocks of COVID-19 on their respective economies, and help affected businesses and households.  However, the large informal economy and unbanked populations in many ASEAN countries also means that the distribution of relief aid will not be an easy task.  COVID-19 have therefore exposed the vulnerable in the community and threatened to widen the income inequality gap among our populations. Governments have to face the difficult challenges of saving lives and livelihoods. Without a viable, effective vaccine, there is no clear exit strategy from this pandemic. The fiscal impact on governments in tackling this prolonged crisis will also have implications on the longer term investments needed for regional development. How do we overcome the COVID-19 crisis?8.        Let me share 5 areas I think in which ASEAN can work together to overcome this COVID-19 Crisis:First, ASEAN solidarity9.     COVID-19 has shown that doctrine of ASEAN solidarity was reflected in our actual behaviour. If you recall, in the early days of the pandemic, ASEAN came together to share information about the new coronavirus and best practices. There are also many examples I can think of, where ASEAN countries supported each other and worked together to tackle the pandemic. For instance, through donations of test kits, PCR machines, personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators between countries; as well as the mutual assistance rendered, such as Singapore’s efforts to look after Malaysian workers stranded here in Singapore due to the imposition of the Movement Control Order, and Malaysia’s help in repatriating Singaporeans stranded overseas. All these have shown the solidarity of our people to help one another in times of crisis. Second, A robust healthcare system to support re-opening efforts10.        The first step to ASEAN recovery will be to manage and contain the current outbreak situation in our region and prevent subsequent waves of infection. This can be done by expanding testing capacity to diagnose cases early, speeding up contact tracing to identify and isolate close contacts of infected persons, and ensuring sufficient healthcare capacity to deal with the potential surge of COVID-19 cases that surely must be expected as economies gradually re-open. While re-starting travel in our region is vital to ASEAN’s economic recovery, it should only be done in a safe and calibrated manner in order to manage the risks of importation of cases and of starting new waves of infection. If such risks materialise, both lives and livelihoods will be lost. Third, Maintain trade flow and keeping supply chains connected11.         The pandemic has exposed the fragility of global value chains by disrupting cross-border trade and transport. A further challenge is the uncertainty of how long countries’ lockdown measures will last, when an effective vaccine will be available, and the prospects for better diagnostics and treatment, as well as the risk from “second waves” of infections being seen around the world. Within ASEAN, countries are also currently at different stages of the pandemic. The economic consequences of COVID-19 will likely linger long after the virus has been contained.12.         So, against this backdrop, there is a clear need to keep trade flowing, both to ensure the supply of essential goods and services, and to send a signal of confidence for the global economy. Trade is essential to save both lives and livelihoods. However, no single country can keep trade flowing alone, or international supply chains functioning by itself. Countries must work together to uphold a rules-based international trading system and maintain supply chain connectivity. ASEAN needs to show the world that we are open for business. 13.           Building on this principle, our Leaders adopted the Hanoi Plan of Action on Strengthening ASEAN Economic Cooperation and Supply Chain Connectivity at the 36th ASEAN Summit in June 2020. Under the Plan, Singapore is partnering ASEAN to streamline non-tariff measures (NTM), starting with those imposed on essential goods such as food and medical supplies. This will reduce impediments to the flow of these items and strengthen supply chain connectivity.  Fourth, Encouraging technology adoption and digitalisation14.           COVID-19 has also shown us the importance of technology in our everyday lives, and accelerated digitalisation. Even the conference today is digital. In the wake of the pandemic, with the temporary closures of many public spaces and retail outlets, and companies shifting to remote work arrangements, digital technologies moved quickly from a strategic priority to an operational imperative – both to accommodate remote workers and to serve consumers as they moved to e-commerce channels. The lockdowns and quarantine measures have caused sharp increases in the adoption of digital channels across the world, especially for purchase of essential items.15.        As our global economy shifts to embrace and accommodate technology and digital solutions, ASEAN too has to focus on inclusive digitalisation efforts for the region. ASEAN countries need to bridge the digital divide by accelerating investments in ICT infrastructure, ensuring affordable internet access, and improving digital literacy in our people. Governments need to create the legal and regulatory basis for the digital economy and enable digitised public services to citizens and businesses alike. 16.     We can also use innovative technologies to combat the pandemic. This includes contact tracing and smart surveillance, as well as decision-making tools for pandemic management. For example, here in Singapore, we have developed an app, called TraceTogether, which uses Bluetooth signals to record those who have been in close contact with one another. We have made it an open source project, so that fellow ASEAN countries and others who want to use or adapt it can do so freely. We have developed other tech solutions too, like SafeEntry, which records people entering and exiting public places. These technologies allow us to identify the close contacts of confirmed COVID-19 cases much more quickly and quarantine them promptly.Fifth, Vaccine multilateralism17.         A safe and effective vaccine will be critical to overcoming the pandemic and getting our lives back to normal. ASEAN should work together as a region to enhance cooperation with external partners and multilateral organisations, such as the World Health Organisation, to procure an equitable, steady and affordable supply of treatments and vaccines when these are developed and available. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that multilateral cooperation is key to responding effectively to global challenges. In this regard, Singapore supports the notion of vaccine multilateralism. No one can be safe unless everyone is safe. ASEAN should build upon the Declaration on ASEAN Vaccine Security and Self-Reliance adopted at the 35th ASEAN Summit last year and explore working together to facilitate and promote cooperation to produce and distribute vaccines in the region.Conclusion18.         To conclude ladies and gentlemen, ASEAN countries must work collaboratively to overcome the many challenges in the face of the COVID-19 storm. There is no place for nationalism or protectionism. Rather, we need to embrace regionalism and multilateralism, as well as proactively engage our global partners to achieve common goals and realise the ASEAN Community Vision. 19.        We are currently at a crossroad. How ASEAN countries respond to this crisis will determine whether ASEAN forges ahead of the competition or falls behind. The way forward for ASEAN to thrive and stay relevant in the rapidly changing world order is to stay united and resilient by strengthening the ASEAN centrality and unity. In the recovery process, opportunities will present for us to build back better. This is the way to be a safe and prosperous region, and a beacon of hope for multilateralism in these trying times.20.               Thank you and have a good conference.[1]WHO COVID-19 Situation Report (17 October 2020).",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-dr-koh-poh-koon-senior-minister-of-state-ministry-of-health-at-the-virtual-35th-asean-roundtable-21-october-2020

I am pleased to be here today with all of you to celebrate Community Care Day 2020. 2.       The community care sector plays a key role in supporting Singaporeans to age well. Community Care Day is a day for us to recognise the hard work of our community care workers and celebrate the efforts to help our seniors age well in the community. 2020 has been an unprecedented and challenging year for all of us, and I am proud to say that the community care sector has remained committed, dedicated and resilient. I thank everyone for your personal sacrifices, and for your sustained contributions in caring for Singaporeans.  Key Roles of the Community Care Sector3.    Throughout this challenging period, the sector has worked in close partnership with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), responding swiftly to changing requirements and engaging us continuously on refining what needed to be done. All of you continued to deliver care to our seniors during the COVID-19 pandemic while going the extra mile to implement measures to safeguard their health. Nursing home leaders rallied their staff to move to designated accommodation so that they could maintain split zones to keep our vulnerable seniors safe. When nursing homes that were affected by COVID-19 cases had manpower shortfalls, the sector responded to our call by contributing experienced staff to help keep operations going. 4.      Over the past months, community care staff have demonstrated great dedication. They conducted and underwent swabs to pre-emptively pick up any infections. On top of their significant load, they also took on the additional work of running activities to engage the seniors when volunteers were not allowed. Some of our eldercare centre operators conducted ‘home-based learning’ for their clients, such as exercise sessions and memory exercises using video-conferencing platforms, during the Circuit Breaker period when centres had to close. Even though there was a need for physical safe distancing, all of you were always close by in providing emotional and socio-emotional support to our seniors. This spirit of adaptability, innovation and self-help within the community care sector is truly commendable. Let us rally together and support each other to further this good work in the days ahead. 5.      The COVID-19 situation has many useful lessons on how to better safeguard the health and wellbeing of our seniors even as we improve care delivery. Community care facilities have stepped up infection control and prevention practices, as well as safe distancing measures and split-zone arrangements, all to keep our seniors safe. Even as we need to stay vigilant, over the coming months, we will study further how to incorporate these learning points into our future plans to prepare for future crises and events. Recognition for Community Care Sector6.         Apart from good plans and protocols, heartware (as in H-E-A-R-T) is also critical in enabling the sector to continue delivering excellent care to our seniors. Last year, AIC introduced the Community Care Fund, for providers to appreciate the hard work and dedication of their staff. AIC continues to make the Fund available to the sector this year and I hope more of you will use this opportunity to express thanks to your staff.7.      AIC has also introduced three other initiatives with in-kind support with donations from corporate organisations and individuals. First, the #StrongerThanBefore initiative has supported 11 community care providers in strengthening operational capabilities during this period, for example in the areas of increased cleaning and disinfection of their premises. Next, the #StrongerTogether initiative supports providers in appreciating community care workers for their tireless contributions. Over 80 community care providers have tapped on the initiative to purchase welfare packs or organise activities for their staff. Lastly, the #ReadyTogether initiative enables providers to maintain service continuity amid the pandemic, including digital solutions like video consultation equipment. We hope to continue supporting our partners as they transform the way they care for and support our seniors. Centres and home care providers can approach AIC to apply for support.8. In addition, AIC’s Thank You Campaign launched in September allowed the public to show their appreciation by penning Thank You letters to community care staff. To date, we have received over 700 letters on the campaign website at www.thankyouproject.sg. The encouraging response to the campaign is testimony to the importance of the work you do, and how the society at large can come together to encourage and support the work of the community care sector. Community Care Excellence Awards and Friends of Community Care9.     Today we also celebrate and recognise our staff for their excellent care through the Community Care Excellence Awards. I am delighted to hear that this year there were over 500 nominations from 36 community care partners for the Community Care Excellence Awards. This is testament to our sector’s spirit of continuously seeking improvements in clinical quality, client experience and productivity.10.      One of the winners of the Community Care Excellence Awards is Mdm Tiong Hoong Yin, a senior rehabilitation care assistant at Kwong Wai Shiu Hospital (KWSH). In her 16 years at KWSH, Mdm Tiong has made significant contributions to quality care and service improvement initiatives. For example, when she found out that one of her clients had a keen interest in sewing patchwork, Mdm Tiong encouraged her to share more about her interest with others at the senior care centre. Mdm Tiong also provided fabrics for her to use. Eventually, other clients became interested, and a special interest group formed. We appreciate the many community care partners, like Mdm Tiong, who have gone beyond the call of duty to connect deeply with our seniors.Introduction of Friends of Community Care11.       In addition to celebrating our staff, we also want to appreciate the many supporters and friends who have journeyed with the sector. AIC’s new Friends of Community Care Awards pay tribute to these partnerships. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals and corporate organisations rallied behind the sector with monetary and in-kind support, which were used to put together the three support initiatives mentioned earlier. More than 20 sponsors generously contributed over $2 million in sponsorship and donated items worth over $3 million. 12.       This year’s Friends of Community Care Awards feature a Special Mentions category to recognise the exemplary efforts of friends who stepped forward to help during COVID-19. This includes the Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS). CFS supported the sector right from the beginning of the pandemic, through pledging part of their Sayang Sayang Fund and securing monetary sponsorships for the sector. To date, CFS has contributed sponsorships of over $450,000 to the three support initiatives. CFS’ generosity also included a sponsorship of 340 units of the GOVTECH Self-Service Temperature Scanner to nursing homes, hospices and eldercare centres. 13.       It is through such whole-of-society efforts that we can ensure that the good work of the sector continues to reach those who need the help. Conclusion14.    The community care sector has remained resilient throughout this challenging year, and I am confident that it will emerge even stronger after this crisis. In making Singapore one of the best places to age in, the Government, community care sector, and society at large must each play a role, and together we can achieve the best care outcomes. I thank all of you again for your contributions, and I encourage more Friends of Community Care to join us in our journey in this pandemic and beyond.15.       I would like to wish everyone a happy Community Care Day and look forward to our continued partnership. Thank you.  ",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/speech-by-mr-masagos-zulkifli-minister-for-social-and-family-development-and-second-minister-for-health-at-community-care-day-2020-virtual-celebration-30-october-2020-11.30am

What constitutes a 'long COVID' case is currently not well defined, and is the subject of on-going studies.2.      MOH has thus far not received any reports of 'long COVID'.

The virus does not respect borders, and no one is safe until everyone is safe. The successful development of safe and efficacious vaccines is a critical step towards overcoming the pandemic.            Global solidarity is required for an effective international response to the pandemic. As part of our consistent support for vaccine multilateralism, and the fair and equitable access and allocation of vaccines, Singapore will contribute US$5,000,000 to the COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access (COVAX) Advance Market Commitment (AMC) mechanism, which will help support 92 low- and lower-middle-income countries’ access to COVID-19 vaccines through the COVAX Facility1. AMC eligible countries include several ASEAN countries as well as small states globally.           Singapore will continue to work closely with our international partners, in particular, the United Nations, the World Health Organisation, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to advance vaccine multilateralism and forge a global response to this pandemic.   1 The COVAX Facility is a global risk-sharing mechanism which seeks to procure, equitably allocate and deliver 2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2021. Singapore is one of 97 self-financing participants (as of 25 November 2020) in the Facility. The Facility’s implementing partners are the World Health Organisation, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

As a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all guests, the hotel has stopped accepting new guests since 19 December and is checking out existing guests progressively. Individuals serving SHN at Mandarin Orchard Singapore have been transported via dedicated vehicles to an alternative SHN dedicated facility. 5.      In total, 394 persons serving SHN at the hotel have been swabbed, and 384 test results are ready, while 10 are pending. Of the results that are ready, 381 have come back negative for COVID-19 infection. 3 have tested positive and were immediately conveyed to the hospital via ambulance. As they have recent travel history, it is likely that these are imported and have been included in today’s case count. Nevertheless the National Public Health Laboratory will conduct whole genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis to determine if they could be linked to the 13 cases. It takes about 4 weeks to culture the virus and complete the genome sequencing. 6.      MOH has also tested 158 staff of Mandarin Orchard Singapore so far, and all the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test results have come back negative for COVID-19. However the serological tests of 3 staff have come back positive, indicating likely past infections.

The changes will be implemented in March 2021.2.   The Government has announced earlier that we will provide premium subsidies and support of up to $2.2 billion over the next three years to help Singapore Residents with their MediShield Life premiums. Following the public consultation held on the MediShield Life Council’s recommendations, we will defer premium payment until end December 2021 for those who do not have sufficient MediSave balances to pay their premiums in the coming year. We will also enhance the annual MediSave top-ups for Pioneer Generation (PG) seniors.3.   These measures will keep the net premium increases for all Singapore Citizens to no more than about 10% in the first year.MediShield Life Council’s Recommendations4.   The Government has reviewed the MediShield Life Council’s recommendations, and is satisfied that the recommended benefit changes will ensure that MediShield Life continues to provide adequate and meaningful protection to Singaporeans. The actuarially determined premium adjustments are necessary to support the rising number of claims and payouts as well as the benefit changes, and will ensure that MediShield Life remains sustainable in the coming years. We also note that the Council will appoint a committee to review MediShield Life coverage for cancer therapies, in response to feedback on the need to contain rising healthcare costs.5.     The key recommended benefits include updating and refining the claim limits to provide better coverage, introducing treatment-specific claim limits for costlier types of community hospital care and outpatient radiotherapy, raising the policy year claim limit from $100,000 to $150,000, and allowing higher daily claim limits for the first two days of acute hospital stays, amongst others. 6.      The higher daily claim limits for the first two days of acute hospital stays will provide better coverage for short stays for patients who can be discharged earlier. In support of this recommendation, the Government will also adjust the MediSave withdrawal limits for acute hospital stays in tandem, as shown in Table A. Taken together, the new MediShield Life and MediSave limits will result in lower out-of-pocket costs for patients. Table A: New MediShield Life and MediSave daily ward and treatment limits for acute hospital stays*   Day   MediShield Life claim limit^   MediSave withdrawal limit   Cumulative limit#     1   $1,000 ($700)   $550 ($450)   $1,550 ($1,150)     2   $1,000 ($700)   $550 ($450)   $3,100 ($2,300)     3 and beyond   $800 ($700) per day   $400 ($450) per day   $4,300 ($3,450) in Day 3; additional $1,200 ($1,150) for each subsequent day    * (Original limits shown in parentheses)^ This is the limit for normal ward stays. ICU ward stays are subject to a MediShield Life claim limit of $2,400 per day for the first two days, and $2,200 per day from the third day onwards. The same MediSave withdrawal limit applies for both normal ward and ICU ward stays.#  Sum total of MediShield Life and MediSave limits, accumulated over the days.  Government’s Premium Support Measures7.   The Government will provide up to $2.2 billion for premium subsidies and support over the next three years to help Singapore Residents with their premiums. This comprises $1.8 billion for existing premium subsidies and support measures for lower and middle-income households, PG and Merdeka Generation (MG) seniors, and the financially needy (see details in Annex A), and $360 million for the new COVID-19 Subsidy. 8.     COVID-19 Subsidy. The Government earlier announced a one-off COVID-19 subsidy for all Singapore Citizens for two years to further cushion the impact of the premium adjustments during this exceptional period. This will subsidise 70% of the net increase in premiums (after taking into account existing premium subsidies) in the first year, followed by 30% in the second year. Taken together with the existing premium support measures, the net premium increases for all Singapore Citizens will be kept to no more than about 10% in the first year. 9.   Deferment of Premium Payment for those with Insufficient MediSave balances. MediShield Life premiums can be fully paid using MediSave. The vast majority of Singaporeans have sufficient MediSave for their premiums. Family members can also utilise their MediSave to help pay the premiums for their loved ones. Nonetheless, to further allay concerns about premium payment during this exceptional period due to the economic impact of COVID-19, the Government will defer the payment of outstanding premiums until end December 2021 for Singapore Residents who have insufficient MediSave balances and are unable to pay their premiums. In addition, the financially needy can apply for Additional Premium Support for assistance with their premiums. Enhancements to PG MediSave Top-Ups10.   Currently, PG seniors receive $200 to $800 in annual MediSave top-ups, which can be used to pay for their MediShield Life premiums. As part of our commitment to keep premiums affordable for PG seniors, the Government will provide higher lifetime annual MediSave top-ups of $250 to $900 to all PG seniors from 2021. For older PG seniors (aged 81 years old and above in 2020) who have serious pre-existing conditions and need to pay higher premiums, we will also provide a one-off MediSave top-up of $50 to $200 per year for five years, from 2021 to 2025. Please refer to Annex B for details on the enhanced annual PG MediSave top-up amounts.11.    After these enhancements, all PG seniors who are 86 years old and above in 2020 will continue to have their MediShield Life premiums fully covered by the special PG premium subsidies and MediSave top-ups, while younger PGs will have about two-thirds of their MediShield Life premiums covered. 12.     For example, the revised MediShield Life premium for an 89-year-old PG senior is $2,025. After taking into account the special PG premium subsidy, the net premium payable is $831, which can be fully covered by the senior’s enhanced PG MediSave top-up of $900. The revised premium for a 74-year-old PG senior’s premium is $1,320 and the net premium payable after the special PG premium subsidy is $674. With the enhanced MediSave top-up of $250, the senior pays the remaining $424 or about one-third of his original premium using his own MediSave or cash. The COVID-19 subsidy will further reduce the net premium payable in 2021 and 2022. Please refer to Annex C for the detailed illustrations after the COVID-19 subsidy is phased out.   13.    Please refer to Annex D for additional details on net premiums after taking into account Government support.14.     Mr Gan Kim Yong, Minister for Health, said, “MediShield Life was created to ensure that Singaporeans would be protected against large hospital bills for life. To ensure that the scheme can continue to be relevant and sustainable, the Government has accepted the MediShield Life Council’s recommendations to enhance the scheme and adjust the premiums. At the same time, we understand that Singaporeans will need more support during this period. We will provide up to $2.2 billion in premium subsidies and support, including an additional COVID-19 subsidy for all Singapore Citizens. We will ensure that MediShield Life continues to provide coverage for all Singaporeans, for life, and ensure that the premiums remain affordable.”15.  The Government thanks the Council for the time and effort committed to the comprehensive review.MINISTRY OF HEALTH 21 DECEMBER 2020",https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/government-accepts-medishield-life-council-s-recommendations-and-commits-2.2-billion-for-premium-subsidies-and-support
